"I mean, there is like layers and layers of lore"
"I think the earliest lore is like, like my mom went to"
"I think, what's the word, fortune teller, right"
"And then she was like, yo, you know, read this"
"And then the fortune teller was like, yo, you know, he, oh, actually something funny was like, first of all, he's like, this person is going to be a great writer"
And I turned out to be a shit poster
"And then he was like, he might be successful"
"But there is a problem where people are going to go after him, right"
So that's the feds
"But the fortune teller was like, so to protect him from people going after him, you have to let him know to be humble and soft so people don't go after him"

"And then he's like, yeah, maybe you can give him a cuter nickname or something"
And then she just called me cat

I don't feel like there's many cons
It's mostly just pros
You're whatever you want and then
"Yeah, you can say whatever you want"
Like what are they going to do
"Like they're like, yo, who the fuck"
"Yeah, I don't know"
We can't sue him for fighting our back
"And then it's like, and then, yeah"
I don't know
"Maybe the only con so far is like, I feel like a bunch of smaller accounts get intimidated or like think I'm like a trillionaire, which I'm not even close to"
"And then like think I'm some like, uh, I don't know"
"They're just like, yo, uh, I don't know"
I don't know about meeting this guy
I know he's definitely safe and legit
"Maybe there is a bit of that, but overall, I think people generally are pretty happy to meet up"
I think the harder to build deeper connection part is me more so because I travel too much
I don't really stay at a place to make multi-year lifelong friends
I don't think I
even have friends that I see consistently throughout a whole year
I got in 18 and then I thought I can just buy and hold and get rich
like Bitcoin from like 3K to 12K like in 2019
And then I was like still super forced
"I was like, you know, I need some leverage, you know, like just maybe like just some, and then yeah, just got into trading"
"And then it became much more of like a kind of like a video game endeavor where it's like, I was way more fascinated than by fascinated by why price moved and like"
figuring it out then thinking about like oh how much am I going to make on this trade I kind of just like had no idea until like sometimes like the trade kind of played out and I'm like
yeah that's how I started
and then I I shared a lot of ideas on Twitter um
and then I was very lucky to have like an actual fund pick me up for a few months where I trade a prop for them um but a traded discretionary uh
as a discretionary trader for them
"Uh, yeah, it was really like a bit of lucky just to like start tweeting randomly and then lucky to have this guy reach out"
"And like, yeah, he, he was telling his friends, yoga is like autistic kid on the internet"
That seems pretty good
Let's hire him
"Uh, and then I just got hired"
"Uh, this guy gave me a login"
I logged in and had like a hundred Bitcoin in it on the max
"Um, I did okay"
"And then I left, went solo"
"Uh, in, in 2020"
"Uh, it was about a month after"
"Yeah, actually, I didn't lose too much because I was like, yo, if I can trade on this account, I don't need to all in my own personal 5k net worth into whatever bullshit, right"
So I didn't really trade it
I just had some dust on FTX and Binance back then
"But the fund I was at was very into, actually, I'm not sure how"
"I'm allowed to say, because I haven't signed paperwork at the fund"
"But you're a cat, right"
But you're a cat
so maybe I can
"OK, well, the fund was very interested into moving the price in favor of their position, obviously"
So we did a lot of bullshit
"Sometimes when Binance went down, we were like, can we shove Coinbase spot, say, market buy one clip"
Can we just send the share 10% or not
It's really so degenerate
"Shove market, see impact"
"Shove in different menus, see impact"
"If we're leading the price on this venue, which other venue gets arped up first"
"It was very degenerate, but it's not quantitative because we don't have computational modeling of if we pump Coinbase versus pumping on Bitcoin on Binance, which"
"which one pumps harder, like, like we kind of have a sense of finance have way deeper liquidity or like we also have shoved on OKX by quality features"
Like these were the biggest products by that back then
And then OKX was like a great platform to
a shelf price back then because Huobi used to also be big and Huobi OKX and Binance was like very well arbed against each other
"And then Coinbase Kraken was way more segregated because I feel like the people that are between Asia and China and US, they're uncertain of the stable price of Tether"
"So sometimes, even if it's like"
tether is like 0.99
"That's like a massive difference on like if you can rbic one or not, right"
"So while it was very degen and we tried to like nuke and like move the market on BitMEX and like all these platforms, we did end up getting a very clear sense of like how this market worked"
So the fund did pretty well overall except in the crash where we actually did short
But I did not long nor short
I was just flat
"The fund didn't do too well, but it did okay in Bitcoin terms"
"But eventually I left and yeah, just did my own thing"
"Yeah, to that point"
"Dude, there was no process"
"It was just completely, what do you call it"
"Like, if you come out of school, you have no job, and then you're just trading crypto with a few grand, you're fucked"
I think I was just more a bit of luck and other people just being bad back then
"I don't think it took that much to figure stuff out or even just to beat the market, right"
And I seem like half of the trading going on is just super gambling
So it wasn't too hard to
like shine a bit like out of that pool of traders
"Yeah, I had no logical like decision of like career big picture"
"Like, yeah, I'm gonna do this"
This is amazing for my career
I had no idea
"I think, I think it would be pretty surprising to, yeah"
it's always surprising to many people when I tell them like my biggest single trait P and I was like
"maybe 2, 300, like, okay, like not more than that"
"Like, but I have a lot of those and have a lot of like losses in that range, but like less often and that's about, yeah, much less like loss in that"
Most of my loss are like much smaller
"So when I did do trade, it was very much just scalp and like"
"Like intro days, intro weeks, like nothing, like I've never held a position for over a month, I don't think, except Doge, which I fumbled anyways"
Oh my God
"So me, Avi Feldman and a few friends, we had this whole thesis in like mid, late 2020"
"Well, late 2020 as in like right before the Doge pump we gave up, but we were like a significant chunk of like Doge"
futures market where like the entire open interest is probably just us to be honest because like I know I personally held over 10% of the market on Doge and I also made sure to like long like exotic quarter lease contract where I don't do not have enough bid to get out after I buy right
but I ended up getting anyways because I was begging like Sam Bankman for you to give me a bit OTC to get out of the quarter lease contract that has zero bid
after a few months of holding that position
yeah um our thesis was like yeah
the best share coin
it's on Robinhood you know if there's like
it's just gonna get driven up by normies like who start getting in
so it played out well just not the trade um when we missed out i don't know we could have i think we collectively missed out on like a few hundred mil
"Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous because at the top like Doge was trading like 200, 300 billion dollars a day like more than like national volume of entire like Korean won effects or some shit like, like, like if you held had $1 billion of Doge, I still find this fact ridiculous, right"
You can sell 1 billion of nothing onto the market and no slippage
That's just insane
"Yeah, they tend to go on for a while"
So it could be a bit deceiving
"But yeah, if every altcoin has so much liquidity, something's wrong"
"Because at some point, well, I don't really"
I can't say for every coming cycle
Maybe this shit is just the norm in the future
But partly because this bottom so far we have had
"Like we consolidate here for a year, right"
"And then you look at like app, like what I would consider absolute vaporware to have multi-billion market cap"
"And then that's apparently the Pico capitulation bottom, like what the fuck"
Like that's our society is insane
"Like, like, like it's just a collective, what, like collective, uh, like pursuit to buy a lottery tickets and degenerate trading"
"Like, and that, that somehow just holds the market up"
"I mean, it kind of makes sense for the world to go in this direction"
So it kind of makes sense
And there is way less attractiveness to trading Bitcoin than alt
"So the top could be probably more ridiculous, right"
"There is always, yeah, I mean, there is some value in like, but I think a lot more value in the prior statement about"
"Just trading, yeah"
"Clearly, just trading"
It's just a game
"I mean, there is a lot of value"
"I saw last cycle where it's very small, by the way"
"Where a lot of artists I knew and I've commissioned hundreds, they were very open to being paid in stable coins or Bitcoin or ETH"
That was very fascinating to me
just much more convenient than PayPal or Wires
"That was just way more, just yeah"
"And unironically, fees on a lot of these are actually cheaper than PayPal"
So that's been good
"So I mean, there is definitely value in just an asset being globally traded over like, yo, you gotta sign up and be a creditor investor to invest or trade or"
"And just fully KYC, which, and then, yeah, many people don't want to do all of that"
"And then if you're not in the US, your access to a lot of these financial instruments are super restricted, right"
So there is definitely a lot of value in just having this open participation
"A lot of what we're gambling on, like 80% or more, like 95% is just like hog garbage"
"It is what it is, I guess"
"Yeah, let's say people that view it as a game, as not real, definitely have done well, but also"
a lot of these have like lost at all just because like they don't feel like it's real and I used to be way more like that
but you know if you go outside and just like even buy anything like like like holy crap this is like a fraction of your slippage that's that's just really absurd right like you got to start de-risking at that point um I feel like
mentally I've de-risked
"de-risked since end of 2020, early 2021"
"But prior to that, a lot of the trading I've done are on way more risk"
A few grand
"Honestly, I don't know, but something I do realize is like, just like how intense the turnover rate is on Twitter in terms of both just people dying out and like alpha where it's like, I see a lot of people posting very valuable stuff that only have like few thousand followers or like 10,000, like, like relatively small, right"
And then here I am kind of the contributing nothing
"But like, maybe like three, four or five years ago, I had a bit more to say about like, you know, Bitcoin and DeFi and like buying like, buying Synthetix and Aave at pretty cheap"
and then longing here and shooting their own youth
"Like, but I see a lot of, let's just say"
It's a very different game in these kind of returns
You can definitely trade on centralized exchange on leverage
"I would say it's definitely harder than 2019, 2018, that period"
But it's still definitely doable
"I would say the main issues like Binance removing liquidation feeds, you don't see the clear picture of liquidation and open interest is delayed by a minute or something"
"Every time we pump or nuke really fast, you're basically guessing if you should sell or not, or if you should buy or not, which can be deducted, but it's just less obvious, I guess"
So it's definitely still tradable
"off centralized exchanges, there's a lot of shit-coining going on where like, I feel like maybe like 20% win and like majority of people just either run into a rug or just like fumble or like just buy the wrong thing"
"But that game is also just like very complex where it's like, like sometimes when shit-coin really stands out, go from like zero market cap to like 100 mil and it's always pushed by like"
a lot of what you call influencers and stuff
"I mean, it is a game you can play"
I can't think if the odds are better here compared to trading on leverage on centralized
There is a lot of this kind of stuff going on where I do see people make a lot of sums
"I do feel like it's honestly, yeah, like for much lower risk, there's a lot of farming stuff you can do, which luckily there wasn't much in my time because I would have probably, I don't know if I would have done that, but maybe I would have"
"Yeah, so I wouldn't have made as much, but yeah"
"Yeah, I don't think it's worth worth for people to farm this anymore unless you do have a lot of capital, right"
"And it's like, um, like points, just, they just work like, um, you know, there's like a, like every company use it, right"
"If they have, if they have a high user base or like audience"
"It's a great, like both marketing, like it's just, it's a great Ponzi and marketing thing to have"
"And I do think, yeah, probably more projects are doing it"
"I mean, they are, like you already see it"
"I don't, yeah, at half a bill, like, I mean, like, I think the TV goes to like more, so it does reach, it's going to reach a point where like most, it's not going to be worth for most of the people to farm it"
"Like maybe even me, right"
It probably is not the ideal farm
"And there's probably better farms out there, which I probably shall not say for my own sake of dilution"
You just move them based on how many people even know about it and how many people give a shit and pay attention to it
That's pretty much it
And then something I learned from behavior psych is
"We always need to have a reason for something, apparently"
"So every decision we make, there's either a more fact concrete reason, or there is a more social reason"
"So the fact reason would be like, hey, we are"
"ABC capital, we took your investor money and we bought Apple shares"
"And here's our reason, like they make a reason for why they bought Apple shares, right"
"And then they're like, oh, the revenue is this, their gross projections that like, it's amazing"
"Like the earning to whatever price, you know, ratio is great"
We're gonna hold this position
"And then like, that kind of is like a cult, actually"
"Like yeah, there is real money"
"Like at some point it's like too cheap, but like obviously like, like if it's trading at like 1500, like it's, it's, it's pretty much like a game, right"
"So it's like, even if it goes underwater, I feel like a lot of these funds are like kind of just become a call"
"They're like, Oh no, we still believe in this"
"We still, it's like, it's like their Bible, right"
"It's like, Oh no, we believe in it"
And then the P is good trust
"And that's like, they just keep holding it"
"I was like, yo, what the fuck"
"Like, and it's kind of the same in here is like"
"And the more social part of reasoning would be like, hey, you have an iPhone"
The tech is amazing
"We got this feature, that feature"
iPhones are the best
It's just amazing
"And then it's like, if you actually look through what they do with their phones, they actually never use 90% of the quote unquote tech they just mentioned"
"And then it's like, OK, are you really buying this for the tech"
say something because that's socially acceptable to own an iPhone and socially acceptable to say why an iPhone is superior
so it's like that's the two main reasoning we give ourselves for our intentions um
and it's very much the same it's like here where it's like the people make up some whatever metric and be like yo this is why this is valued at this and why it's like gonna go up or down and
"Or like, yo, GCR bot, so it's now fashionable for me to own a position"
"Or it's like, oh, Kobe's into, yeah"
I'm in the trend
This is the new Balenciaga of the coin to hold for this week
So it's very similar in that
"And especially if you're in a Discord group and everyone apes a shitcoin, you kind of know"
You're probably about to ape that thing
"Overall, it's just how many people know about it and how many people really care about it"
"In a sense, that gives valuation to these tokens"
"And attention is really important now because you could, quote unquote, have amazing tech"
"If no one talks about it, no one even heard about it, how are they going to buy this coin"
"we've reached a point of where, in my opinion, social media is kind of like the fundamentals"
Or like we're getting more and more to that point
"And then it's like, some people may be like, yo, some protocols actually make money, yo"
What do you mean
"And then it's like, yeah, well, if no one talks about us about this on social media, then it never made money"
Because people won't hear about it and they're not going to buy it
"But everyone shows like, oh, this protocol makes money"
"Even if it's not a lot, it's going to the tokens probably going to go up"
"So, yeah, it's very much just getting to a point of just hyper"
Influencer like social media ish market
"Yeah, I would say"
"Yeah, and I think the GME was actually just like the start of like all of this for triad file like I think like even like common stocks like in"
"Yeah, maybe not the major stocks, but the mid caps and small caps are definitely going to be moved by a lot of retail in the future too"
"Honestly, no, I'm pretty horrible at that actually, which is why I don't dabble so much in the altcoin market"
"Yeah, I actually mostly just do like big caps and the flows they talk about or I've mentioned that is actually more just like, you know, like if Coinbase is buying on spot and perps are longing on perps, like dude, it's just gonna go up, right"
So that's the kind of flows I trade
And I'm a very aggressive trader who does not care about entry with no distinct stop loss
"But some kind of momentum way to stop loss or time way to stop loss, more so than price one"
"If spot and purpose are both buying the last hour, I'm just going to buy it"
"Yeah, I'm buying the top"
the next hop
right like so like i'm very aggressive and stuff like that and like if they stop buying then sure you know i'm very i'm very likely looking to like just close out no matter where the price is if it's higher or same or lower
so that's i guess just like trading momentum honestly but
"You also do factor in some stuff like, hey, you know, we've, everyone's been buying and longing for like three weeks"
"You know, if momentum breaks here, it's going to be huge"
"So then I might jam in on like a reverse, like, you know, no one's bought in like six, like six hours and the open interest and leverages and funding rates are jacking"
"You know, I'm going to jam on the first, uh, like sell, sell momentum, right"
"So there's, there's a lot of game to like, like that"
In terms of flows and then you're kind of just praying the people who've been buying like take some profits or like panic sell or whatever
"Hey, so that's a lot of the flows I trade"
And I think jazz is a much better narrative trader than me
"And most people, honestly, like"
"I'm the type to think about, oh, Doge could be the next narrative, and then just not even have any exposure"
"I'm probably not a great altcoin trader, except for DeFi, I guess"
"That was just very obvious, maybe because the groups I hang out with are more on the funds sides and the retail side"
Maybe it's more obvious if you talk to 100 non-institutional traders every day
"I mean, that's a lot of alpha, right"
"They might start talking about X coin and all of them like, yeah"
I don't have exposure
"And then you're like, fuck it"
I'm just going to long it
"Like, I don't know what they do honestly"
"But when I was like, like people whose funds are talking about DeFi, they're like, yo, we can't deploy because there's no liquidity"
"I'm like, that's so bullish"
"So, so that's the more like"
"the stuff I hear about, so I may know a bit more of"
I do remember the Synthetix Aave trade
"I was buying Synthetix at like sub $1 and then like every $5,000 USDC buy I made on chain, it was moving the price 2%"
"And then I was like, wait, I can't even, you know, pack a $50K back then"
I'm going to move the price up 20%
"That's ridiculous, right"
"So you're really, like, really trying to not stop the price too hard"
Yeah so that was like a very different trading
and I don't even put too much into like these trades because like I just had no idea if
"it really does play out or not, although I kind of feel like it almost was definitely what was going to play out"
"It was like pretty much the only thing that was new and shiny and like the only thing people talked about and it's like, it's just ridiculous, right"
"Like, hey, hey, there's a new smart contract"
"You put money in, you get some yield here and then you get the token"
"Now you get the token, you dump it, your yield is now this amount, which is like, let's say like 300%"
"People thought it was a scam and like they all just kept talking about it and it was just a very strong momentum and attention, right"
And then it's like
"oh, now there's some funds deploying some capital"
We have a big fund
"Let's slam a mill into this farm, get some risk-free return, unless you get robbed, which I assume some of these funds had a dude who actually can read some code and be like, hey, this seems to be safe or not"
So a lot of funds started farming DeFi later on
And that was one of the main things a lot of funds did in 2021
"But yeah, in 2020, they were just getting started"
"And yeah, it was pretty much the only new thing where you can leverage on-chain, borrow money on-chain, and then just do this and that, some funny mechanisms where people have never been able"
do before or they could but there was just like no size at all
I actually remember I deposited one ETH into Dharma in 2019
and then I was getting 4% yield
and I was like you know this is like
so cool like I can see like this ETH going into the pool and then like actually back then it was like individual pools so if you want to borrow ETH you have to like either find
someone who's like willing to lend out the same amount or something
it was it was badly designed I think
but I can see the exact address I borrowed my ETH
and I was like yo that's fascinating like I know he has to pay back because like he's gonna get liquidated for a way more amount of USDC if he does not pay back right
so and that USDC goes back to paying me buying like one ETH and sending it back to me
so I knew it was safe unless like
"We really just abruptly sent 100% in one minute with no liquidity to cover, which was not really possible"
"But yeah, something really insane has to happen for it to work"
"Oh, there's so many sectors now and honestly, I don't really know like half of them to be honest cuz like I guess like if you tell me about games and AI and like Like I just have no idea like Like I feel like games they make some revenue from like, I don't know selling skins or some shit"
and then it's like
"Are people buying and then like, I guess you can project something, but AI is just like such a new world to me"
"Like, I don't know anything about AI, so I'm just not going to talk about it, but some people may actually know something about it"
"and then they can be like, okay, cool"
"Uh, this, this, like, I don't know, right"
"Like they can make some stuff up about, or they may see something like people don't"
"And then if you believe in that, like AI"
narrative to have and then sure
"And then now we have RWAs, which I also don't know about because it's like, I do like the real world"
Are you serious
"Like, I thought we were trading, I thought we were trading like magical internet money"
"Like, what is this real world stuff"
"Like, that's crazy"
"yeah, I mean"
But like I am kind of foolish on it because just like the overall fact that you can just earn yield like yield is like everything yield related to yield and just giving out free money is just foolish right because it's like it's just it's just a meme people have always accepted and like like about like just earning over time
yeah anything with yield is just it's just good in my opinion it's a good thesis
"Someone could see something there and be like, okay, this is clearly undervalued"
I don't want to name or talk too much about specific projects
"Honestly, I don't even know how safe they are"
"If you know, then you know"
I don't think they're overlooking because like we already have a lot of people talking about it
"And then it's like, well, like I honestly do not know like what's the exact mechanism people are bringing like, oh, whatever yield from whatever government is like to on-chain"
"Like there is few forms, the people are also just buying like, oh, like, yeah, hey, our protocol owns like a thousand houses here"
We're renting them out and this is your passive income
"And it's like, yeah, what"
"Like, like, like, like, like out of no clue how legal that is, or like just how ruggable that is, like how safe it is"
"If you know it's safe and you think it's undervalued, I think then that can be a good play"
"Also, I feel like part of the meme is not really about us, but a lot of new buyers are going to be a mix of just our generation and then the older generation, which probably prefer something that sounds like something they already know, which is like RWA would be something they kind of know, right"
I feel like that's also why we've always got a persistent bid
"It's just like, Hey, we partner with banks"
"It's complete like scam, but like that sounds so legit, right"
"So it's like, it's a great Ponzi"
"Like they just keep saying, yeah, we're, yeah, this bank, yeah, international wire, bro"
"Like, and it's like, they just get a perm a bit"
"And it's like, that's, that's just crazy"
How many years has it been
Does he still think it's going to a thousand
"Yeah, I think it is"
"And I think at some point it is going to be really, really bad to get to a point where it's just so bad that we try to find another system that helps it get better again, which is why I was so"
just into some kind of rep system
"Even AI is getting really good, right"
"So it's like, yo, if we can't even distinguish a celebrity between, are they even real"
"We can't even tell, right"
"Because it's like, especially in this industry, it's completely acceptable at this point that you're just some character"
"So if there's some weird cartoon character animal that's screaming out tickers and they just keep pumping, if they're an AI"
they're going to be like the overlord of like a corner of Twitter where like they can just keep influencing the market
"And then it's like, or just like way more like of these like bought it accounts or like fishing, like scam and like, does that just like scam people, right"
"Just tweet links, DM people, random like promotion stuff"
"Yeah, I can see it getting pretty bad"
and it's really hard
to for like one entity to filter all of these out because like if there is a rule like on like on the internet i feel like it's or just like overall like i feel like you there is like a way around it so it's just like
hey we did this implementation to like get out get the bots out
and then like you you have like a million team of like
people who just want to like code some BS bot to like scam some money like it's like no risk but full return
right so it's like it's such a great thing to do uh if you're just if you just don't care about like ethics and uh just want to make money
right um so you got all these smart people that's just gonna find what the rules are and just spend around it and just keep you know buying social media accounts and
like going for it um i think it will get pretty bad and then like
a rep system where like if everyone if every like actual living being participate in it then it's it becomes much more harder for like a bot to really infiltrate although that's obviously at the cost of like the entire society putting time into into this and um
although in real life the entire society do put time into this which is why i thought it could kind of work because like like if we meet and like
"a group of friends of me, they might talk about, hey, that guy, I don't trust him because he did this and that"
"Words spread, right"
"But it doesn't spread as easily here, I feel like"
"Or people just forget, forget, because these posts get buried in a week or month"
Or people just restart an identity
It's really easy to restart an identity
But it's hard for an identity to really stay and get really big
"I always saw a friend tech was a mix of just like a mix of both rep and something else, a bit of like how much, how active you are or like how"
much ETH are you spending kind of and then like and then there's like a bit of Ponzi where there's three three going on and then there's a bit of like actual utility where it's like
okay i can buy this like maybe there's like i would say maybe there's actually at least five good traders on the platform where you know there's genuinely uh like a justifiable lifetime price to pay for um
i i don't really need that because like
it's really hard for me to trade off other people's opinions
Kind of like if you log into someone else's trading account
"and you see like five positions, you don't really know why they're open, where they think it's gonna go, like you have no clue how to manage these from that point on, right"
"So it's kind of the same where it's like, okay, this guy said this goes up, okay, by how much, I don't know"
"Or like if they say by how much, I don't know man, like it's just like"
It's just not your trade
So it's like really hard for you to have a conviction in it
"And then like, it might draw, draw down a bit and you might panic, but like if that guy have way more conviction, then you, he might hold and he might be right"
"So it's like, a lot of this is like really hard to, for me at least"
"So I don't really do that, but, but on"
There is some value there
"And then a bit of like influence and uh, but"
"Overall, I still really like the platform, to be honest"
I've met a lot of people there
And part of it was actually just me buying a bunch of accounts that are of the Asian community
And I bought some Middle Eastern people
"And then they're like, hey, yo, if you want to get into my homies group chat, here's a link"
And then I joined these chats
And it's really cool just to see what you're talking about
"I thought that was like probably like, obviously, it's not worth like what how much I spent like, I'm not gonna say"
but that was still at least something came out of it
It wasn't just like I bought like a scam and then they went to zero
I'm still quite happy with how it played out so far
"Yeah, although yeah, like"
"It could be better, but yeah, not complaining"
"I hope the points are worth something, but we still don't know at this point"
"Yeah, that's another problem"
"It takes a lot of time to get good at this, as in to even know what you're reading is like how legit this guy is"
"I feel like as you spend time on this website, you kind of subconsciously build like a kind of like how legit they are score"
And then they are like a
"OK, this guy's not very good"
But this guy's pretty good
So I think it's pretty innate
Most people probably kind of have a sense of how to use it
"But yeah, I would just say, yeah"
I guess just find people and see if they're like
"I mean, a lot of their tweets can be backtested"
"And then it's like, a lot of accounts do delete tweets"
But I feel like it could be pretty obvious
"You follow them, too"
"And I would definitely always make your own decision, just because that's how you actually really get good at something, not from listening to others"
"Yeah, I think it's a bit of both where it's like, I tend to find it hard"
"I mean, like everyone's different"
"But it's hard for me to have conviction on something that's just like a higher time frame, just because the uncertainty just gets bigger and bigger as more time there is for you to guess what's going to happen"
"So even when Bitcoin was breaking out of like 12 to 16 to 20 K, like I was pretty sure all of that was going to happen, but like I could only hold a position to like 16, for example, right"
Cause like I knew like I'd retrace would come and then it's much harder for me to mentally read long like 15 K
"It's like, bro, I've never longed my whole life"
"I like my two years of two, three years of trading so far has been a Bitcoin is like five K, eight K, you know, like 15 is crazy"
"I think it takes some skill to adjust to that but, and like I should have thought about, like yo, this is a time where you do not think about what the fuck the price is when you're longing"
"Like you sold 16, it's time to rebuy 15 if you think it's going to 20, right"
"But I didn't rebuy the size I want, but also just like if you're on like some form of leverage, which I was, then"
it's really hard to hold a position from 12 to 16 and then just keep holding even though you know like we're gonna like wait to like 14 or 15 just from like some profit taking and then it's like like you get you got to hold that for like a week two weeks like that's crazy like like it's really hard to sleep it's really hard to do a lot of things where like and then you just have like a massive mental block on your head where it's like
"I have a ridiculously sized position on this magic internet money, which I think is going to 20k, but I know for this week it might scam me"
"So like, like it's just like, you're going to suffer for that, like, like 10 days to like, uh, I'm very much of like a life maximalist where it's like, or happy maximalist where it's like, Hey, you know, just"
"Yeah, I do not want to win more"
Just get me out of this stress
"So I'm more of that kind of, yeah"
"Obviously, good risk management"
And most people I know do really well are pretty humble
"And then the not-so-humble ones tend to go bigger, but I've seen them draw down also much more"
"Yeah, just get ego, being humble, get at risk, having the ability to know you're wrong"
the ability to think you can be wrong and you're not invincible or just know everything
I think that's really good
"Well, usually I always maybe set my positions"
"I might play a game of League or two, but I can still tap out and be like, OK, it's not necking to zero right now, or going to infinity where I'm short"
"But overall, mine's just very momentum-based, or just kind of just monetary-based"
"If I'm down six fakes, I'm definitely looking to cut, even if I think it's going to bounce in favor of my position, just because I tend to have this system where"
"If I'm wrong by that much margin, then I do not deserve to be breakeven to begin with, even if I think it's going to like, uh, retrace to my entry immediately or something"
"Um, so this, I guess this, this part of trading is where I see as a game and not like real money"
"Some of the, some of the trading stuff I do is not definitely not very, um, I guess like just perfect EV or something"
That's pretty good amount
"And then there's always kind of like a, a feel of like, we're like a price level ish"
"I mean, it's pretty obvious where like people get liquidated and stuff, but"
"Yeah, there's also a gut feel of how bad that move is going to get if we go to this level or that level, right"
Because I feel like the data is not as transparent
You kind of have to take some leaps of assumptions where I think
"If we dipped 5% here, we utterly fucked because that destroys everyone on x20 leverage, which is pretty common, honestly, for this market to have"
"And then it's like, if you also assume a lot of positions are open and high leveraging around the same price, we've been consolidating"
"And then if we move against all these positions, they're going to have to close"
And then that's going to cause probably way more moves in percentage-wise
"And then, yeah, so those kind of gut feels are pretty"
"It's both a guffier and somewhat quantitative, I guess, in a sense"
And how did that turn out for you
"Earlier today, Bitcoin was at 30%"
and I just thought and that's like the highest spin in like I don't know a week or so
and then I just sold at 38 flat um
so I mean that's just like pure momentum
and then yeah didn't make a ton on it maybe like 10k
I I don't trade a lot anymore
but like today I'm home
and I kind of saw
like like okay the
The momentum is just crazy
It's definitely going to test 38 somehow
It seems like you go off vice
"I mean, this is just such intraday BS stuff going on"
"Honestly, not even worth talking about, but yeah"
"Oh, I love the, they are going to dump it or like they are going to put the price"
"It's like, who, who's they bro"
"Like they, like they do not exist"
"You know, like there is no like God in this market"
"That's like, yeah, they're protecting it or like they're going to like send it"
I feel like that's like some misconception people have
There is just like a lot of fucking rich kids and a lot of fucking rich people in general
Like that's in this right
"they're all, they all love to gamble and they're all gambling alongside you"
"So it's like, and you might not know why they're buying and selling"
"So it's like, when price don't react to some news, like, Hey, why didn't we dump"
Like there's such bad news
Like the person buying might not even know what's going on
They just wanted to buy and fuck off
"Like, like some, some things can not just be, can just not be explained"
"And like, you don't have to think it's like some weird, like"
"Like they, that's influencing the market"
Oh my God
"This is always the hardest question because it's like, what do you say to help like all these people get rich"
I do not know
"I'm trying to, it's pretty hard for me to get richer myself"
"Like, like, honestly, I do feel like bigger accounts are overrated, small accounts are underrated on average"
And then I think
There's a lot of alpha in these like on-chain traders and a bunch of the smaller centralized exchange traders where not many people are following as much just because like they don't ship posts as often
"And then, yeah, I think a lot of big accounts are pretty like just overrated in general"
"They do have a lot of say in like just momentum of ship points because like, I mean, you know, if like everyone"
over a hundred K follower tweeted a ticker like bro that's just gonna send right
but like like a like a smaller account may be talking about stuff that that's that's less just like less aggressive but actually like kind of valuable
or it could be talking about something that big accounts catch on later
Networking is amazing
"I mean, like you, you can, like a lot of these group chats, they're not exclusive at all"
"They're just like, yo, if you're, if you're just like a nice guy out there"
And you're cool
People are just going to add you to a bunch of random chats
They may be good
They may just be playing games
"But eventually, you make friends with them"
And some of the bets they take do make money
"And it's like, or you just all get rocked together"
I don't know
"I think a lot of the small cancer out there, especially, maybe been around"
for a wall like if they survived like all the FTX and like all the rugs and implosions Luna never holding a single UST like they're pretty smart
right like so I feel like or not if they're not smart at least they're good at risk so like the chances of you like like if you can get in touch with like a group of these friends or like a like smaller people on Twitter I think that's pretty
Pretty fucking good
and it's like you don't have to be like following the big accounts like I like even for me like I don't feel like I tweet much saying stuff useful for you guys or they say for anyone right like maybe apart from like
hey I think Bitcoin eats the bands
and it's like someone with this size may have a more opinion like some opinion or actionable thing to do
but like I I don't feel like a lot of stuff I say are very
"So I remember just like one day I came across this shitcoin worth $3,000, $4,000, $5,000"
And it's just like this sock from Uniswap
"And I was like, okay, this, like, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever fucking seen my whole life, right"
"Like the ETH was at like 1k back then, or like, no, no, no"
ETH was at 200 and this shit was at 5k
"Cause like, this was like 2020, right"
And it pumped because every sock holder was going to get like the uni airdrop
So it pumped to 10k
Everyone bought it
"And then like, it just stayed at like 3, 4k for a long time"
"And I was just like, I bought like 10"
gave five out for free
and I was like yo this is just absurd I feel like and just how absurd the fact that it was at 5k kind of just made it keep going up
and now it's just holding at 40 I mean and that itself is just fucking ridiculous
right like why the fuck do people hold this I don't fucking know which is why I'm holding it
I mean it's just for fun like
I don't know if it goes much higher
I don't think many people hold it to dump
So I don't think it goes too much lower
"But again, I don't know who the fuck would buy this"
"So it's just probably going to maintain at some value all the time, just because it's ridiculous"
Some questions are better left unasked for the sake of our industry
"No, not really"
"All right, all right, all right"
