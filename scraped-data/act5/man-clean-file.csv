Put the needle on the record
"Uh, doing very well"
"Yeah, I think I'm just generally pretty happy, happy cat"
"So yeah, always, always positive"
So I got in 2018
"Actually, it was kind of a because I was horny"
"There's this good this girl in my college was like, yo, pull up to the blockchain club"
"I was like, no, no fucking clue what the fuck that is"
"But you know, her, her thighs were crazy"
I just followed her to the blockchain club
She's like talking about stuff I have no idea about
She told me XRP was a scam
That's all she said
"So I was like, sure, you know, I'll give you all my cash"
Buy me some crypto
So I bought like two grand of Bitcoin
"Then in a month, it dropped from like six grand to like three grand"
"And I was like, incredible"
"Like I don't know why, but like I just kept buying"
So that's how I got in
"And then I realized that, you know, just holding Bitcoin is like"
"makes me poor, because I went to 13K, I only went from five grand net worth to, I don't know, 15 grand net worth"
"And I was like, yeah, this is not working out"
I need to start using a ton of leverage
So that kept going
So that was how it started
"The catalog is multi-layered, multi-dimensioned, much deeper"
"So when I was one, my mom took me to a fortune teller"
And the fortune teller was like
"Wow, he's going to be a great writer, which is very true"
My tweets are always bangers and hitting
"But he said something else, which is really worrisome for our bloodline"
"He's gonna be like doing all right, like pretty good, but there's like a massive issue, like there is evil behind him, like trying to get him"
"But there's a counter attack, like you can prevent this, right"
"And she's like, yo, of course I wanna prevent it"
"And he's like, he needs like a very cute nickname, then he will do really well"
"And then she was like, huh, all right"
So she started calling me cat in Chinese
So that's how it started
"So, um, and then like, you know, many, many, uh, years later, uh, and this is like, these two events are not even like related"
"Um, I didn't even know like, or I, like in my head, I didn't even know this background story, um, nor was aware like why she was calling me a cat, whatever bullshit"
"Um, and then"
"One day, a bunch of my friends were like, you know, this, this is like totally you"
"Like you should just beat, like beat this"
And it was like some cat profile picture
"And I was like, yeah"
I'm down there
"You know, why not"
So I became a cat
"And then, um, over time, like, you know, COVID happened"
"I had to put on the hazmat suit, you know, virtually, you know, virtual COVID could hit you hard"
So I got this hazmat suit
"I chose yellow and then, um, you know"
"And then one day I was like, wait, hold up"
"Like, why my, that same identity as like, well, my mom's calling me"
I had this like insane realization like maybe two years later
So I asked her and then she told me the fortune teller story
"I was like very mind blown that it like, it all bridged together"
"So I think that's a, that's a full door of the, yeah, the cat persona"
"No, I think it's very unique, like easy to recognizable"
Yellow is like adorable color
I think it's very good
"So like at this point, I don't think I'll change it"
"And it's like, if you want to like"
take off my like hazmat suit
"I was, um, yeah, pretty much"
"Yeah, I think not near 99% of my gains is like Bitcoin ETH just trading"
"I mean, this is hard to explain, but like"
"Like there's always levels which I, well, at least to me, it's like relatively obvious"
"I watch people take positions and I'm like, and then you automatically in your head generate a mental liquidation profile of all these trades, right"
So it's like very simple
"Like if they're on the X20, it's 5% move, you know, it's X25, 4%"
X10 is very popular
So like 10% moves usually never happens
It always runs like few percent deeper just like from these liquidations
Or just generally stop losses being triggered at a pretty obvious level
"And then at least when I used to trade, I try to shove it a little bit more into that way so they get fucked a little bit harder"
"and then I sell into when they're getting fucked and then, yeah"
"Uh, a bit of everything"
I think I
For a while I really really loved knowing where price was going
It was like this strong curiosity and like urge to
"just want to be correct, just want to know why each moves are happening, and then predicting it, and then put a bit of money on all my views"
"And then over time, I'm not sure why, it just doesn't hit the same"
"And on top of that, there's one day, I think almost the very last day of December 2020"
"yeah, last day of the year"
"I was just like, you know"
"I had like an AVI bag, not too much"
I had an SNX bag
"There weren't like millions of dollars, but like, I just felt like the swing was so crazy"
I just kept going up
"I'm like, why am I still holding this shit"
"Like, or like, like all my trades are working and hitting like, I'm just going to take a break for a bit"
"And then once I took that break, I"
It was so mind blowing how I didn't realize how stressed I was
"I didn't realize it was like, you know, clouds above my head"
"Because I do it 24 seven, you know, when I sleep, I dream about it"
I had an ex I like when I fuck I'm actually thinking about the chart
um like there's there's like there's no nothing else in the universe other than like me like trying to outplay someone on like btc usd perps so it was like
just i like i don't know i just couldn't like redo that ever again just because like
yeah once once that stress and everything like lifted um i was just like
you know i was just happy to live like this um nothing's wrong
yes this is great um this is what
i guess originally fought for and
"I'm just going to, yeah, not go as hard"
That's also hard
I think it's around this
It's not too much harder
I think it's still very doable
"I don't really trade too much anymore, but I can still"
"like take a quick look and like, like sometimes I have a very strong bias and my hit rate at least mentally so far, like I've mental trades I'm taking and they're hitting pretty well"
"Um, so I don't know, I've ascended to a level"
"I'm just like, yeah"
I'm mentally taking profit here
"Like, Oh, that was a great trade"
"Like, yeah, yeah"
I still got this totally
"Like, if I made this trade, I would have been right"
"So yeah, just stuff like that"
So I definitely think yeah
"it's like the ETF coming in, it's not like completely a meme, at least in the moment, right"
"It's like, the flows are so strong, you can like just trend follow"
"I don't know, there's so much bullshit you can do still"
"A lot of it still trades similarly to 2019, 2020"
Maybe there's less percentages
"We hit a bunch of traders' margin levels, and then maybe we do 3% instead of 20%"
We used to bar it nonstop
It definitely matured in that sense
3% still so huge
"Yeah, I'm extremely proud of the July, August move in summer 2020, because I think I'm the only one on Twitter who's calling like, we're going to send so hard that Binance is going to break"
And it literally broke
It was the biggest candle
"I tweeted out, it was like, I give it like one third chance"
We're going to print the biggest move in Bitcoin history
And I think it was a move from like 28 to like 40K on Binance futures
um in like two minutes or something something crazy like that um so i'm very validated by that like just um just that that just means like i was correct about the market's positioning and
then like where the recreation levels were and like people just getting cascaded into like empty books so many of them in fact that blindness goes down like like these being correct like
and then i also said how like market will never short the short like bitcoin this hard ever again which we haven't seen so far
"So like that's like one thing I'm pretty proud of, I guess, but not really too many memorable trades"
I actually fucked up that trade super hard just because I was holding the position for a month and it was just ranging and doing nothing
"Um, but I still managed to catch a decent move"
"So yeah, if you're up here, I'm happy"
"So yeah, like, yeah"
"Yeah, basically what you said is I think amazing, like just absolutely ascended mentally, like nothing is gonna like you're never tilted, obviously, you're not going to revenge trade, obviously, like, at least that that to me is like very barbaric behavior, like if you can't like even mentally control your like your like discipline, like your mental state, if you can't control these, um"
I think that's pretty barbaric
"I don't know if that's insulting, but that's just how I view it"
"I don't think I've ever had too much problem with discipline, but that's definitely improved a lot as I traded over time"
"Yeah, I think mental is definitely the most important"
"Because if you can think clearly, then you're going to have good risk management"
"You're going to think how much you're going to put on where you're going to cut, where you're going to just eat the loss"
Just stuff like that
"Um, and just accepting your wrong is so critical too"
"Um, yeah, for sure"
"I respect people who can accept their wrong so much, just because I feel like the average dude in finance is like, always like the big Dick, like, I don't know, like Ferrari, like it's always like, you know, uh, very high T, um, not saying that it's low T, but I think it's more mentally ascended if you can like accept where you're wrong"
"So it's just like, yeah"
"As for like levels breaking and like reactions, I guess I do have some of these"
"Like let's say if I see the market is like super shorted, but like if we take a high and like"
It's like a very weak
like very few amounts of shorts coming out
"I might have to doubt my assumptions, stuff like that"
"But generally I also don't do any news at all just because, you know, I'm clicking on the like literal retail interface on like Binance or some share"
"I'm not gonna like, I'll compete these all goes or whatever, like popping off in like 200 millisecond, whatever, whatever, right"
"I don't ever, so I don't do any like information stuff"
"Yeah, there's been a few times where I'm just like literally trading and then CPI comes in"
"and I'm like, what the, I didn't know, which is like absolutely like retarded of me, I guess, but that happened a few times"
"And otherwise, yeah, I just do my thing"
"I guess just like low information, more, just more chart and more, uh, like, like, I don't know the momentum trend, like right"
"Definitely, I don't take notes either, I guess"
You can do whatever you want
Everyone's a bit different
I don't think there's one way to win
It's probably any other money-making thing
There's definitely a lot of ways
"Everyone's different, yeah"
"Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious it's changed"
"a while ago, but I think initially I think I was much more excited about signaling via key purchases and sales"
Although I was never treated anything like
so I fantasize about a lot of things I think and
I think I wished it was something like
"Okay, we tell each other who we like and don't like via buying and selling keys"
and how that could signal to like people who aren't as in the strict
and I don't know that this entire like CT cabal like who's a better actor who's like a not as good of an actor
Although the main problem with friend tech was it actually had no true negative signaling
"And negative signaling had to be done in an anonymous way in my opinion, just because otherwise it's just extremely like aggressive, right"
And I don't think people are like open enough to do that
"I think generally that kind of stuff people tend to be a bit shy even if like, I don't know"
"you're like an MMA fighter, you're not going to go online and be like, I hate this guy, literally like click this button"
"So I think that was one issue I didn't realize very early on, which was like lack of negative signaling and how there was only positive signaling"
And then that kind of turned into more of a Ponzi real quick
"Um, I guess after like two, three months, I realized like, okay, this, this is actually not as cool as I thought"
"Or like, I was just like, um, like I was fantasized"
"I was like, like having this fantasy of the, the same being something else, which is like totally not, um, right"
"So I, yeah"
"I think I, I didn't like mention about like price or like"
Like the airdrop going into like the token event then didn't tell anyone to buy it
I just like averaged out real quick and like one day People are like you're retarded
"And I'm like, okay, whatever"
there's not much you can do so besides like the the negative signaling is there anything else like in retrospect that you would like change about the platform to make it more on a
I mean like just claiming the airdrop was like every the entire community was like having aids from like trying to even like get it to work so I think that's pretty bad because like UI is like very critically important because like I think not maybe not enough people or brands or just like projects think about this but like
Your experience with something is very critical
"So if you have a negative experience or that's a negative emotion about this thing, then you are literally more likely to not want the thing, which is the token, whatever it has to do with it"
"But if you have positive emotions about something, you're more likely to buy the thing"
It's like how marketing 101 is
So it's like the fact that the app lacks so hard
"was definitely a problem, I think, in my opinion"
"And then although they try to fix it, it was always kind of a thing, right"
Especially when we all try to use it
And I think otherwise it's a completely okay platform
I don't think he ever meant it for it to be reputational
And I think I just fantasized about it being that because
"us buying and selling keys were a public display of liking, right"
But I think Racer really wanted it to be kind of like a fan community thing
"Like, oh, you think Hasaka's a go, you think I'm the go, you think Ko... Not me, sorry"
provided any value
"Like if you thought Kobe was a go, you know, you buy like two of their keys and then ask them some nice questions, they will reply"
So that's like real value
"And there's definitely a market for that, but like definitely not like whatever billion, five billion, 10 billion, I was like mentally jacking off about, right"
"but I guess if you have a thousand fans, that's"
"he is that expensive, kind of, I guess"
"It's hard to justify all of this, I guess, but I think the model was mostly okay, at least I thought so, especially if you are not in a for-profit, right"
"Because once you buy the, I don't know, there was some certain level of price, it takes exponentially more buying for you to even be able to get outbreak even"
I think that that part was good in that it prevented speculation or like way too much of that
"But it was also obviously very like extractive on because people did try to like, you know fuck around They found out really hard way like, you know, all the fees were just like"
Did you guys sell your own keys did you dump on your on your fence
"No, I still have like"
"I don't know, 50 F or like 30, at least, yeah, probably around 50-ish F in the thing"
"Yeah, I did try to play it"
"I bought a bunch of smaller accounts and I bought multiple keys, stuff like that for the smaller accounts"
"I actually self-sniped seven keys, 70 keys because, yeah, because people were gonna snipe it and then like"
"Yeah, I didn't sell that because that just like looks really bad"
And so you don't need a couple of E's
"So it's like, it's okay to just like put it there"
"Uh, there was definitely, uh, a couple, uh, notable accounts that promise to share that airdrop and, uh"
I will not go further on this topic
"Check, check the chain"
"I don't know, man"
"Yeah, I think"
"Actually, before we talk about this, can we also talk about life"
"Because I actually want to know you better, because I don't know anything about you actually"
"We can go after this, but yeah, for point systems, I guess, I mean, they obviously work, right"
"Like it's, it's not like a Starbucks and every, like, I don't know if like chase, like any airline are doing points because it doesn't work"
Like it clearly works
And it's like
"Yeah, it just works"
It's very simple
We all like want to get points for whatever reason
"It's like crazy, but that's how our brain works"
And I guess
"yeah, Tation was pretty early on to that, like the blur, right"
"I've always thought of him as like one of the greatest, greatest like Ponzi builders in the space"
And on top of that
It tend to come to something like slightly new
So it's like pretty good
"Um, and like, I just had to invest because he, like, you know, he, he literally stole open sea from open sea"
So it was like a no brainer at the time
"Cause there was, it wasn't much other deals"
A bit of both
"I thought, I mean, like, why not"
"Why not have all the funds there, like, earn some yield"
"It makes everyone more money, right"
"It's like, it goes, it's way more 3-3 than like every other"
"Parking your funds anywhere else, right"
So I thought it was like decent enough of a idea to go for
"That's such a hard question, but I don't think I've had too much gigatrillionaire dreams or what I'm going to do with it"
"Yeah, no clue"
"Honestly, I'm just going to do the same thing because it's pretty nice so far and I'm very content with my current"
"Although not extremely, definitely not hyper wealth at all"
"Yeah, pretty happy with that"
"I mean, like, you have to put it in my hands for me to like, start thinking about it"
"Right, so I guess one thing would be like what I've seen of hyperwealth, you know, yeah, continue to live in hotels"
"But actually, I'm not sure"
"But like, I guess I want a private chef"
"So when I wake up, there's like food"
"I want like extremely, extremely, extremely healthy food, because I am like"
It's very into being healthy
I've not had a full glass of sugar beverage for nine years
I don't even eat birthday cakes at all
"Actually, I've made two exceptions this year or one exception here and there, but you can count them in one hand"
That's how little sugar I consume
"And like, I always have broccoli, like either broccoli or berries almost every day"
"That's just my vitamin C fiber, like antioxidant intake"
"You know, I just make extremely healthy"
"And then like after, and I always eat that first because when you eat that, like, and then you have like your favorite fruits, like say I'll have a pasta, it's a little bit of carbs, not too crazy"
"But then, but because you ate the fiber first, you actually digest that way slower"
And then like your glucose spike is like way softer
Just stuff like that
I hear a lot about my appearance
My skin is in amazing conditions
Every girl would be jealous
And then I guess I also have like a bunch of like
like somewhat philanthropic thoughts
"I know this word is like giga curse now because of saying bank man, but like there's like a bunch of like, yeah"
there's a bunch of like content creators
"Like I really, really like respect just because like you can clearly tell like, Oh, this guy or this girl, like they are completely not selling out"
"They are, they're like, say producing content purely like the amount of passion they have for say a video game where like"
whatever they're doing is like so great that that they just do that and that they have no view about like like no sense about like be doing business or like like how this doing this or that can make me more money so like if I can like support more of these people like it makes me really fulfilled I guess
yeah um just because like I guess I do follow a bunch of these people and like they I just think they're very cool um I'm very big into like
"expression, virtual expression, or just like expression in real life, I dress well"
"But yeah, just like stuff like that, I really respect like people who do that online too"
"so yeah, stuff like that"
"If I can support more people, that's like very awesome"
"But yeah, I think living in hotels is like an amazing door and like me"
"As I said, I'm someone who lives in a fantasy"
I just want to do this forever
"I want to stay young forever, which is why I have all these routines"
"Although I've done a few lines of Coke before, I don't think that's really bad for your aging"
A few lines before
It's all delta neutral
I had a lot of broccoli hours before
take other stuff for preventing higher blood pressure if I do stuff like this
"Yeah, definitely hedged"
I do care a lot about this kind of stuff
But I also value a lot about having fun with my friends
Emotions is another thing
"I'm a big maxi-elf, yeah"
"Sorry, you go"
"Yeah, I literally eat the entire plate of broccoli"
Like it's like a massive plate
I will literally finish it before starting the steak
"It's like, it's pretty easy to me because I guess I made it a habit and just like, you know, I'm a trader"
I have the discipline to do that
"Oh, I, okay, this might be like disrespectful, but I do not respect any other trader"
I do not respect any like whatever influence
"So just cause like, I'm going to just like absorb the information and like a lot of readings"
"I love doing readings and then just like, or trading"
"Like I always have my own view, my own system"
"Um, whenever I listen to others, like it worsens my, it actually makes it worse for me"
So just like
"Like I know if you eat five weeks before a real meal, you will have like"
a slower glucose spike
"This is like proven countless times, right"
"Like just stuff like that is like, basically are facts, uh, proven nonstop"
Like I will do them
"Um, so I don't have a lot of influence"
"Yeah, the scientific term of like these, uh, like the, the impact of a meal is called like postprandial spike"
"You know, the first time we read it, like Google, like 18 words out of 30 words in the first paragraph"
"But you know, it's honestly not that crazy"
"You open a paper, yeah, first minute you have to Google half the shit, but then you understand everything and then you keep going, right"
"It's like, it's honestly not as scary as people think"
I absolutely have thoughts on it
"My biggest two beliefs about education is one, we need to teach about online fraud because"
The economy is already going so virtual
We have Amazon now
We didn't have it 15 years ago
We have eBay
All these things are popping off
So much skin trading and obviously crypto
"And then people are getting all these emails that are like, oh, you're a student"
"And then I don't know, some school should get hacked so easily"
And then you get a fraudulent mail about your school deposit
"Yeah, you already got rubbed on FTX and then a fake claims email come out, you got rubbed again"
"And it's just not crypto, exactly"
"It's like so much everywhere, right"
And then another big belief I have is everyone needs to learn about research methods
"So this course in college teaches you how to research information for yourself, right"
But it's just like this general idea of trying to obtain correct
like information for yourself is just so important like
yeah i feel like many people don't really get to learn that or
like yeah they just don't right so it's like these two topics are like very critical in modern day that i think like no school teaches about it
it's just like or it's not like a critical course
but like it's like it has to be like a foundational course in my opinion yeah
"Yeah, way more"
Way more than everything
"I had no like, like when I finished school, like I didn't apply to a job, like not sure why"
"And then all my friends are like, yeah"
I'm going to this
"Oh, I got an internship to begin with, uh, but it's Intel and or like some shit"
"And I'm like, Oh, cool"
"I, I have nothing to say"
And then just traded this Ponzi and like had to learn to go
Never took a single finance course
"Like, yeah, definitely"
I had to
"And then one day you're treating the, you know, the most popular product, the PTC USDT, and then tethered depex, three pegs, three bibs"
"And then you're, yeah"
And then you're scared
There's a lot of shit going on
I did actually panic sell
"It was pretty bad, but I actually bought, I just bought spot instead"
"So I was just like, I'll put a few percent in versus it was kind of like, okay, I guess"
"Like, I don't know anything about signature banks"
"I'm just like, yeah, you know, I'm going to go and eat going fucking Ethereum bro"
Like fuck this shit
Learn something new today
"If my bank's insolvent, I lose 3% confirmed by the real estate GCR"
"Oh, also as a, as, as real estate GCR, I was going to ask about like, how is this right"
"Um, yeah, like for like me, like mid tier homes, right"
"Like, cause I'm not like elite, like hyper both whatever, like if I buy like, uh, is it, am I buying the top right now"
"But like the shit only goes up, right"
Like I'm staying in hotels as like a funding way to like shore housing and it's not working out for me at all
But I don't know
Maybe it's just a trader mindset
I just don't want to buy the top
"Yeah, that's fair"
I should just look at it like fashion then
"Like, oh, I bought this nice piece of jacket"
"Oh, wait, the secondary market went down like $200"
Our advice has been obtained
for from real estate GCR
"Yeah, real estate GCR"
"So this is, I think one of my most, my biggest weakness is like this kind of views because like I've always treated on like day to day, week to week and most short-term stuff"
Maybe I'm most like one or two months
"Like I don't think I've ever had a trade where I'm like, yeah, like Q4 is going to pop like, and we're in Q2 right now"
Like that just never happened
"Overall, I do tend to think that people are over-exaggerating the top signals"
"Because if you go relatively cycle by cycle, DeFi summer was absolutely crazy, even for people who went through 2017"
"And they were like, yo, this is crazy"
"And then when the first DeFi pullback, everyone was shorting"
"So relatively, I think we're kind of similar in that celebs are popping in and that's to me just about as crazy as 2021, if not even a bit less just because we don't have that stimmy checks, we don't have that kind of stuff"
"Um, and I think my views are really weak by the way, just cause like, I'm an absolute retard when it comes to like, just kind of like macro view"
Cause I know nothing about macro
I didn't even know Trump's was favored until like GCR set in
"And I'm like, yeah"
I have to trust like politics GCR or like literally him side
"Like he is literally the go of politics, right"
"So I'm like, he's like, yeah"
"I'm like, okay"
Trump won guys
"Like, yeah, like, I don't know anything about like"
and he's going to somehow pump the markets
I heard like apparently it's super bullish and he's like confirmed at this point
Basically they could even assassinate him
"He, my bro, my bro literally turned his head and it's like just nailed it"
"Like, like it's so crazy"
"Like, so I got"
I don't have too much
"I think I heard like a third of the Gox points are bought out and then like some, something like that"
"And then it's like, yeah"
"but I don't know if they're going to sell, right"
They're definitely in for a profit too
"So like, yeah"
"Yeah, like the last few weeks were definitely a bit more like shorter and like less allocated"
And then this week inflows were really strong so far
"So that's been really promising at least like, like for the first time we have like a 30% like pullback where like, you know, TradFi"
"bros are like, yeah"
"we're bidding like 200 mil inflow, 300 mil inflow"
So that's like
"impressive, I guess"
"Cause like at some point, I think people were talking about like, Oh, if we have a 30% pullback, the ETF is going to start panic sailing or something"
And we didn't really see too much of that
So that's pretty strong to me
"But I'm always like, like on crypto, I'm always like softly perma bullish, I guess"
"I definitely am like, definitely do call cycle tops like last cycle"
I kind of did
definitely do get bearish
"But yeah, I think we're still like somewhat pre definitely"
"The QRTs goes hard, yeah"
"Maybe, I don't know, lifestyle GCR"
"Yeah, because I think I just live my own fantasy, my own world"
I absolutely do not care about anyone's opinion on what I'm doing
"I'm dirty in my bubble, very moisturized and like in a hotel right now as we speak"
"Yeah, actually first time at, I'm at right now, first time staying"
Probably a decent review at the end of the stay
"Yeah, I still haven't explored even all the hotels because I'm pretty like autistic in the way"
I need to do the same thing
"So if I go to a new hotel, where do I go to get coffee and breakfast again"
Do I have to go here now
"like a, I don't know, habit break"
So I was like staying at like some other hotel for like months
"Whenever I go, I was there"
"Uh, so, uh, I've not stayed at too much, like chain hotels, honestly"
"I've always preferred medium, smaller brands"
"Um, I guess I was impressed by like Pendry service when I was like checking in"
"It's just like, I had three massive chat dudes, like protecting me, opening the door and carrying my luggage up"
"I was like, wow, you know, even four seasons didn't do this"
This is crazy
"Uh, I don't know if you've heard of Pendry, but they don't, they only have like, I don't know, like five branch or something"
"Yeah, honestly, nothing too notable"
Like Marriott stole my unisex socks because I just have a package there
"Physical one, it was worth 80 grand when it was thrown away by them"
"Yeah, I just literally had it on my desk"
It literally just looked like a cardboard box that's empty because it weighs so little
They literally thought it was trash and threw it away
"I'm like, dude, we need to go to the trash truck right now to get it back"
It's a highly valuable personal item
"And they're like, oh, it's gone, bro"
I don't know what you're talking about
They don't remember what they threw away
"I'm like, all right, I'm never coming back"
I've only been to one in New York and I didn't even stay there
I just went there for
"I went to the bar and then I went to the restaurant in it and then, cause my friend was staying there and he showed me around and I was like, yeah, that's very impressive"
I'm not paying like five grand a day
Like I'm not like hyper wealth
"But yeah, especially for me, like I'm not hyper wealth"
and I do this every day
"Like I literally cannot do a five, 10 grand, like that kind of stuff every day for years"
"So it's just like, yeah"
"Yeah, sounds like my dream, yeah"
"Except I just give them my laundry and they overcharge me by like $200, yeah"
"Wait, how much was it in COVID like worth $250 a night"
"Even during COVID, it was $500"
"I'm just doing like around between five, maybe like three to one K, 300 to one K that varies a lot"
"Yeah, for sure"
"Yeah, I'll bring it up in the next pod"
"Oh, that means we're in part two"
"Yeah, thank you guys"
