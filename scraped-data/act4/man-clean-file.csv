"CL207 uses VQ for his virtual cat appearnce. It's just a normal camera, but you install this app."
"It's just like, observe your face muscles and stuff, and just telegraph that onto whatever model you have. Like, they have to input, like, okay, what part of this face is, like, this cat's muscle is going to move if the human starts moving, or stuff like that"
What I'm more surprised about is that people are really angry actually
I got so much shit for that
"So the question was basically, if I remember correctly, was something akin to one guy buys like $50 worth of Bitcoin and the other one buys like $100 worth of Bitcoin."
And it was just basically using the leverage as in like the one guy that bought 100 did it without leverage and the one that bought like 50 did it with like 2x leverage
And people just got it completely wrong
"They were like, okay, well like 4x leverage, the second guy"
"But they were like, okay, adding it up and it was basically just"
"They weren't really understanding how leverage works, which is like, you don't necessarily like when you're saying like, I bought this with 4X leverage, that doesn't have to mean that you just bought your entire balance and then 4X it whatever"
"Yeah, it's not how it works"
"But I mean, I'm not surprised about that"
"Most people just don't read this stuff, like the documentation on the exchanges"
"But like I said, I'm surprised that people like are so ambivalent, is that the right word"
To like learn how it actually works and instead just got angry with me instead
"Actually, I've never thought about that"
"yeah, a lot of them just have no idea what they're talking about"
"But like, I don't really like engage with everyone"
"But like, if it's someone I know, then I do like answer about it"
"Just any, but I guess adding to what you actually just told me, I guess a lot of people don't think twice about"
like what they're seeing
"Like, say, oh, this phenomena happened"
"Like, say, oh, suddenly this one exchange is extremely negative funding, or another exchange has super weird CBD going on"
And then I feel like it's pretty important
"You actually do go to that exchange, check out the trading history"
like basically find out like what caused it because like like just general understanding of what's happening is pretty important I think if you're only trading right like because like then you know
okay if if you see that signature happen again then you kind of know like what's going on
"Good thing I did early on was like every any time I saw like something some sort of like data happened, which I was not sure like why was happening"
I kind of just like scared at it for hours seeing it going on
"Like, yeah, I remember like in end of 2020, no, sorry, end of 20, I'm thinking like we'll be about to head into 2020"
"I remember these Asian exchanges, they had futures that were way more backward than the ones on BitMax"
"And then I was like, OK, isn't it free money"
"You sell BitMax by a whole, but you sell BitMax by OKX"
"And I was like, OK, what caused this"
Why did this happen
I think it would be safe to assume there was a bigger seller
"Ideally, you do find out if that's actually the case, right"
"So like, yeah, I think price was like at 7K and then some really big shorts were opening on these Asian exchanges"
"And yeah, like I was checking the open interest there and it was just like 50, 60 or like 70 mill worth of shorts, like just pushing the market down"
"And like that made, I remember at that time, Quobi and OKX"
they had like March futures that were like hundreds of dollars below Bitmax
"And at 7,000, $6,000, like a couple hundred dollars is pretty big percentage wise, right"
"So that was like, yeah, just an example of like dislocation and why you should figure out what happened"
"And yeah, actually later on, I think that short got liquidated on the way up at 8,600 and that pushed like"
the premium significantly above Bitmax
"So you could have bought into his shorts and sold it back to him, basically opposite end of the premiums"
And basically you could have hedged that to you through Bitmax
And that would have just been a sick arbitrage
How do you take advantage of that
Did you take advantage back then
I remember seeing that guy like gigashort and then like BIMX started shorting too because like all the crips and like future data like futures are also like basically they were all negative so I was like
yeah screw this like you're not allowed to be like disparish on this asset
"so I started longing like around like 6,800 all the way down to like 64 and luckily we did bottom"
so I guess that was just like buying the dip
"Technically, it is one-to-one, right"
"Say right now, I market long a Bitcoin, and then I'm buying it from probably the market maker, right"
"So the market maker is now short a Bitcoin, because he just allowed me to buy the other side of the contract"
And then imagine this
"The market maker now, he's short one Bitcoin"
"some sort of trading desk and be like, yo, can we have like one Bitcoin to borrow"
"And for like, say, very low APR, probably like 1% or something pretty low, right"
"Because like, yeah, like Bitcoin doesn't get much yield because the short demand is not like, extreme, right"
"Like, so they borrow a Bitcoin, they sell it on spot, their position is like totally dealt in neutral, they're chilling, they have a ton of collateral, the market maker is happy"
And you're on leverage
And you're watching your P&L flash nonstop
And you have a liquidation price
So who's actually taking the risk here
It's not the market maker
You're the one taking the directional risk
"So if everyone's taking that kind of risk, you can say every contract is valid and stuff"
"who are the one pressure to sell actually, right"
It's obviously the one that are taking the risk
"So like, yeah, if price start moving down, I'll be the one selling and because I don't want to be liquidated, right"
So then I would sell my Bitcoin and that causes the price to drop more
"So essentially like, yeah, technically it's one to one, but the amount of risk these participants are taking are definitely not one to one"
"You have to think which side of the market are the riskier bets being made, because usually it goes against them"
"And it's not just because, oh, they all have to lose"
"It's just the nature of this force where it's like, OK, if majority of the degenerate people are longing, and then say price just moves down a little bit"
a few of them are pressured to close
"That just makes the price drop more, which causes the medium risk of people to close, which in turn then, say, causes the price to drop even more"
And then that then hits the even lower risk people
"So it's kind of like, yeah, if all the degenerate are on one side, it's kind of inevitable that some sort of cascade snowballs against them"
I don't know if that makes sense
"I mean, funding is like a good indicator in that regard, goes in the same direction, I would say"
"But I mean, what I usually do, like I hang out in discourse"
and I hang out in like in chat rooms
"And then I have people like CL and people like other people that look at the same data basically, and they keep spamming about it"
"So I actually know like how it's looking like most of the time, even if I'm not looking at it"
So I don't even have to like actively look at it if I want to know about it
"No, but like it doesn't affect like funding affects my trading"
"I don't really like go much, much deeper than that"
"I think funding is more than plenty, but I always appreciate like more of an insight"
"And then when I'm like, okay, this is that support and I see negative funding and I see like people really turning bearish"
"Then I'm like, okay, it's probably going to bounce"
And then I go to my trusty friends that know more about the leverage aspect of it and who's short and who's long and how the market's looking and ask them
"And then if they agree with me, I mean, that's usually good confidence to have"
"Right, so negative funding doesn't mean it's net-shorted, right"
"Because the per basis is live, right"
It can be hammered down temporarily just because lungs are Rushing out
"So so like yeah, we've seen a quite a bit of negative funding for like Let's see"
"Yeah, like the first two days after You know like May 19 we had negative funding and we bounced to 40, but we started nuking on negative funding again"
So why is that
So it's like like my interpretation of it is like
you have you've had like three four months of just like all these lungs trying to buy more and they and I like I knew was unhealthy but like it was hard to tell when it will fully get white right because they it's
you just can't never tell because they can
And I guess that Elon Fudd did it
"But yeah, you had multiple months of longs accumulating in a range"
And then they suddenly want to all get out within a few days
"So there is this liquidity crisis where it's like, OK, why would I long"
Why should you be longing
Why would you buy someone else's long
Why should we bail them out
They must either sell it to us at way cheaper prices
a ton of negative funding then like
yeah you get some you get like incentives too for people to like start
like yeah we can buy out these trapped longs but like otherwise like all these all these months worth of like lungs opened above like the range they were just getting out
like we just had like multiple days of like that
and and now that open interest has like pretty much settled like like as in like okay
"Yeah, I don't think there's like much overhang in terms of like, in terms of like old long positions anymore"
"So I think now it's like, negative funding, if sustained, like would mean more"
"And, and sometimes you see negative funding, like, say, intraday, or like, interweek, like we get negative funding for just one day, but then you also, at the same time, you go to like, the three months futures and like the rates are like 20 30%"
"And you're like, okay, so the average lending rate is still positive 20% for the next few months"
So why should you assume the market has no loans left
"That just doesn't make sense, right"
The PIRP can get into negative funding just based on lack of liquidity for a lot of loans to exit in a short period
"But yeah, people should really be watching the multi-month futures"
"especially the ones on like FTX, Huobi and like I think Binance is also getting more liquid"
"but yeah these are like the most liquid interest rate markets in crypto and like and that's like way more determinative of like the sentiment, at least I think so"
"I mean, in my eyes, it's just like when you have like negative funding and support, right"
"It's just like buying gets cheap, right"
"You can just I mean, it's you know, that like a bunch of people are selling into you basically below price"
"And I mean, it just makes it a little bit more attractive"
Like I wouldn't say negative funding and just buy this
That doesn't make any sense
"But it's like, if you like"
want to buy anyway
and you're just waiting for something and you get negative funding for a day or two then you're probably gonna or like even you've had negative funding for the down move i mean it just makes sense to bounce in my in my eyes it's less sophisticated
but i mean for me it works
like like few days ago when we dropped like 32 31 um like like
"Not only like all the curbs went negative, like the end of June futures were pretty negative too, so that was a pretty good, relatively easy buy"
"It just means people's future expectation of price appreciation is low, right"
"If it's at 0%, right"
"So it's like, yeah, that just means the market is not bullish at all"
"And then if you also look deeper into what the positioning actually is, usually these are also because people are trying to short against the move, which causes"
"So essentially, these shorts would balance out the longs"
"So there is net, no leverage, which is why the interest rate stays at zero"
"So usually, that's been, or at least in 2018, when the futures started getting more popular on BitMEX, it was still, I don't know if every backwardation market, a local bottom at least"
"Now that futures are way more liquid and the majority of the volume, it has been marking bottoms, I would say, pretty reliably"
"And it's almost mathematically hard for it to not be a bottom, too, because it essentially just means that there's a lot of shorts"
And the smarter participants usually just start stepping in whenever that happens
"Yeah, so backwardation is just the future"
data contracts for Bitcoin is trading below the current spot price
"Essentially, that's a contract where you can buy on leverage"
"It's paying you to buy it, which is usually very rare for it to happen"
"Content goes the opposite, where people are paying an interest to use leverage, which is how it should be"
Because you're basically borrowing money
"Wait, sorry, you cut out first there"
"I think staying backward is pretty good, usually"
"Yeah, I don't think there's been many cases where it's sustained backward, and then you see significant drawdowns"
"But yeah, I do remember clearly, just on the May 19 drop recently, at first, Ether went to 2,300, 2,400, and that already pushed June futures to negative"
"But I don't know why it didn't buy it, but yeah"
"But then, I think 20 minutes later, it went to 1,800"
"And I was like, holy shit, people are really getting absolutely destroyed"
"I guess it's hard to pinpoint, OK, this is where the liquidation cascade stops"
"So if the market has been long, net long, for a long period of time"
you can expect a while for all these long contracts to capitulate out of the market
"So yeah, usually the longer it stays leveraged for, the more severe that kind of drop happens"
So you maybe can just wait and set it out instead of trying to catch these temporarily
"that last for like a couple minutes or something, so"
"It's pretty hard sometimes in the futures markets, right"
"Liquidity wise, because I mean, I remember, it's gotten better, but I remember back in the day, I don't even know on which kind of like move it was, but I was trading on the futures and then I was trying to exit my position and I just couldn't"
"And I mean, I think like super, super short moves"
"Back then, it wasn't as liquid as it is now"
"These short, quick movements below are oftentimes people that just want to get out, but just can't find the liquidity to do so"
It just closes and it goes quickly below and then other people that are
"that are not under pressure, because I mean, let's be real, right"
Let's say you long the future and it starts going against you
"I mean, that's, for me at least, much more terrifying because you know that it can go backwards, right"
"And then you're like, okay, shit, my risk is here"
Where the fuck is this gonna go
"And then, yeah"
I've been trapped like that before and it's not fun
"With these kind of sharp moves, like the small ones, can often be just one person or a couple people not having enough liquidity, basically"
And then the bigger ones are just really good buy opportunities because it's going to go to
"market price eventually, right"
"So you're just getting paid to buy something, which we're all bullish on anyway"
"Like if you think if you just be backwards for a long time or like for like big for a bigger size, whatever, I mean, that's just pretty much free real estate right there"
You just get that
"In my opinion, anyway"
Usually historically at least like 20% been pretty good easy sells but like that was in the fair market like like okay
like we have prices been in a range for like years and
and then it pumps 20% and then like you see futures like 25% and that's like like annualized that's like okay people just start selling but this bull run has like slightly exceeded some of my expectations I think like we were at like 50% plus and like that's very like and these are like multi-months like very liquid interest rate markets so it's like
"Yeah, that's like billions of dollars on futures making locked in yields of like 50% annualized or more"
So it's been pretty crazy
"And because of that, it's been pretty hard to use it as a signal to pinpoint tops because"
