Taiki Maeda,"What is up, guys"
Taiki Maeda,Welcome to episode seven of the Crypto Market Wizards podcast
Taiki Maeda,Today I have here with me the cat CL207
Taiki Maeda,How are you doing today
CL207,Very happy to be here
Taiki Maeda,What's like the origin behind the cat
Taiki Maeda,Like when did this become a thing
CL207,"Yeah, it's always been"
CL207,"I mean, there is like layers and layers of lore"
CL207,"I think the earliest lore is like, like my mom went to"
CL207,"I think, what's the word, fortune teller, right"
CL207,"And then she was like, yo, you know, read this"
CL207,"And then the fortune teller was like, yo, you know, he, oh, actually something funny was like, first of all, he's like, this person is going to be a great writer"
CL207,And I turned out to be a shit poster
CL207,"And then he was like, he might be successful"
CL207,"But there is a problem where people are going to go after him, right"
CL207,So that's the feds
CL207,"But the fortune teller was like, so to protect him from people going after him, you have to let him know to be humble and soft so people don't go after him"
CL207,"And then she's like, oh, cool"
CL207,"And then he's like, yeah, maybe you can give him a cuter nickname or something"
CL207,And then she just called me cat
CL207,the original lore
Taiki Maeda,"Got it, got it"
Taiki Maeda,What's it like being a pseudonymous character
Taiki Maeda,"I think you mentioned in some posts that you travel all the time, people know you as Kat, so it's harder to build real life experience or it's harder to build meaningful connections"
Taiki Maeda,What are the pros and cons of being this Kat online
CL207,I don't feel like there's many cons
CL207,It's mostly just pros
CL207,You're whatever you want and then
CL207,"Yeah, you can say whatever you want"
CL207,Like what are they going to do
CL207,"Like they're like, yo, who the fuck"
CL207,"Yeah, I don't know"
CL207,We can't sue him for fighting our back
CL207,"And then it's like, and then, yeah"
CL207,I don't know
CL207,"Maybe the only con so far is like, I feel like a bunch of smaller accounts get intimidated or like think I'm like a trillionaire, which I'm not even close to"
CL207,"And then like think I'm some like, uh, I don't know"
CL207,"They're just like, yo, uh, I don't know"
CL207,I don't know about meeting this guy
CL207,I know he's definitely safe and legit
CL207,"Maybe there is a bit of that, but overall, I think people generally are pretty happy to meet up"
CL207,I think the harder to build deeper connection part is me more so because I travel too much
CL207,I don't really stay at a place to make multi-year lifelong friends
CL207,I don't think I
CL207,even have friends that I see consistently throughout a whole year
Taiki Maeda,"I don't think you necessarily need an introduction, but how did you get into crypto trading"
Taiki Maeda,When and what do you do now
CL207,I got in 18 and then I thought I can just buy and hold and get rich
CL207,like Bitcoin from like 3K to 12K like in 2019
CL207,And then I was like still super forced
CL207,"I was like, you know, I need some leverage, you know, like just maybe like just some, and then yeah, just got into trading"
CL207,"And then it became much more of like a kind of like a video game endeavor where it's like, I was way more fascinated than by fascinated by why price moved and like"
CL207,figuring it out then thinking about like oh how much am I going to make on this trade I kind of just like had no idea until like sometimes like the trade kind of played out and I'm like
CL207,yeah that's how I started
CL207,and then I I shared a lot of ideas on Twitter um
CL207,and then I was very lucky to have like an actual fund pick me up for a few months where I trade a prop for them um but a traded discretionary uh
CL207,as a discretionary trader for them
CL207,"Uh, yeah, it was really like a bit of lucky just to like start tweeting randomly and then lucky to have this guy reach out"
CL207,"And like, yeah, he, he was telling his friends, yoga is like autistic kid on the internet"
CL207,That seems pretty good
CL207,Let's hire him
CL207,"Uh, and then I just got hired"
CL207,"Uh, this guy gave me a login"
CL207,I logged in and had like a hundred Bitcoin in it on the max
CL207,"Um, I did okay"
CL207,"And then I left, went solo"
Taiki Maeda,When did you go solo
CL207,"Uh, in, in 2020"
Taiki Maeda,Like was this before the COVID crash or was it after
CL207,"Uh, it was about a month after"
Taiki Maeda,"Like I think last time you met or we met, like you told me about like some crazy like experiences you had like in March of 2020"
Taiki Maeda,"Like, do you mind sharing to our audience, like what happened then and like how you recovered"
CL207,"Yeah, actually, I didn't lose too much because I was like, yo, if I can trade on this account, I don't need to all in my own personal 5k net worth into whatever bullshit, right"
CL207,So I didn't really trade it
CL207,I just had some dust on FTX and Binance back then
CL207,"But the fund I was at was very into, actually, I'm not sure how"
CL207,"I'm allowed to say, because I haven't signed paperwork at the fund"
CL207,"But you're a cat, right"
CL207,But you're a cat
CL207,so maybe I can
CL207,"OK, well, the fund was very interested into moving the price in favor of their position, obviously"
CL207,So we did a lot of bullshit
CL207,"Sometimes when Binance went down, we were like, can we shove Coinbase spot, say, market buy one clip"
CL207,Can we just send the share 10% or not
CL207,It's really so degenerate
CL207,"Shove market, see impact"
CL207,"Shove in different menus, see impact"
CL207,"If we're leading the price on this venue, which other venue gets arped up first"
CL207,"It was very degenerate, but it's not quantitative because we don't have computational modeling of if we pump Coinbase versus pumping on Bitcoin on Binance, which"
CL207,"which one pumps harder, like, like we kind of have a sense of finance have way deeper liquidity or like we also have shoved on OKX by quality features"
CL207,Like these were the biggest products by that back then
CL207,And then OKX was like a great platform to
CL207,a shelf price back then because Huobi used to also be big and Huobi OKX and Binance was like very well arbed against each other
CL207,"And then Coinbase Kraken was way more segregated because I feel like the people that are between Asia and China and US, they're uncertain of the stable price of Tether"
CL207,"So sometimes, even if it's like"
CL207,tether is like 0.99
CL207,"That's like a massive difference on like if you can rbic one or not, right"
CL207,"So while it was very degen and we tried to like nuke and like move the market on BitMEX and like all these platforms, we did end up getting a very clear sense of like how this market worked"
CL207,So the fund did pretty well overall except in the crash where we actually did short
CL207,But I did not long nor short
CL207,I was just flat
CL207,"The fund didn't do too well, but it did okay in Bitcoin terms"
CL207,"But eventually I left and yeah, just did my own thing"
Taiki Maeda,"So would you say that, you know, you joined in 2018, you're trying to, you know, trade up a small account, uh, couldn't do it, use leverage and then eventually like joined some prof fund, uh, and then learned like the more, how the markets moved"
Taiki Maeda,"And then eventually you said, you know what, like, let's just like, let me do my own thing"
Taiki Maeda,Is that kind of how like your journey is in crypto
CL207,"Yeah, to that point"
Taiki Maeda,What led you to take that leap
Taiki Maeda,"What made you say, you know what, let me do my own thing"
Taiki Maeda,Did you think that the opportunity was worth it
Taiki Maeda,"Because you don't really have a stratified background, right"
Taiki Maeda,"You just join the markets, price go up, price go down, try to figure it out"
Taiki Maeda,What was the process like for you to just go full-time
CL207,"Dude, there was no process"
CL207,"It was just completely, what do you call it"
CL207,"Like, if you come out of school, you have no job, and then you're just trading crypto with a few grand, you're fucked"
CL207,I think I was just more a bit of luck and other people just being bad back then
CL207,"I don't think it took that much to figure stuff out or even just to beat the market, right"
CL207,And I seem like half of the trading going on is just super gambling
CL207,So it wasn't too hard to
CL207,like shine a bit like out of that pool of traders
CL207,"Yeah, I had no logical like decision of like career big picture"
CL207,"Like, yeah, I'm gonna do this"
CL207,This is amazing for my career
CL207,I had no idea
Taiki Maeda,"No, I mean, that's like most people, right"
Taiki Maeda,"I mean, we just kind of have like a gut feel or gut instinct"
Taiki Maeda,"and we say, you know what, like, I feel it in my bones, you know, just fucking go along"
Taiki Maeda,"Do you have like any memorable traits or like, I don't know, like memorable moments that like led you to, I guess, quote unquote, make it"
CL207,"I think, I think it would be pretty surprising to, yeah"
CL207,it's always surprising to many people when I tell them like my biggest single trait P and I was like
CL207,"maybe 2, 300, like, okay, like not more than that"
CL207,"Like, but I have a lot of those and have a lot of like losses in that range, but like less often and that's about, yeah, much less like loss in that"
CL207,Most of my loss are like much smaller
CL207,"So when I did do trade, it was very much just scalp and like"
CL207,"Like intro days, intro weeks, like nothing, like I've never held a position for over a month, I don't think, except Doge, which I fumbled anyways"
Taiki Maeda,What was that Doge trade
CL207,Oh my God
CL207,"So me, Avi Feldman and a few friends, we had this whole thesis in like mid, late 2020"
CL207,"Well, late 2020 as in like right before the Doge pump we gave up, but we were like a significant chunk of like Doge"
CL207,futures market where like the entire open interest is probably just us to be honest because like I know I personally held over 10% of the market on Doge and I also made sure to like long like exotic quarter lease contract where I don't do not have enough bid to get out after I buy right
CL207,but I ended up getting anyways because I was begging like Sam Bankman for you to give me a bit OTC to get out of the quarter lease contract that has zero bid
CL207,after a few months of holding that position
CL207,yeah um our thesis was like yeah
CL207,the best share coin
CL207,it's on Robinhood you know if there's like
CL207,it's just gonna get driven up by normies like who start getting in
CL207,so it played out well just not the trade um when we missed out i don't know we could have i think we collectively missed out on like a few hundred mil
CL207,"Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous because at the top like Doge was trading like 200, 300 billion dollars a day like more than like national volume of entire like Korean won effects or some shit like, like, like if you held had $1 billion of Doge, I still find this fact ridiculous, right"
CL207,You can sell 1 billion of nothing onto the market and no slippage
CL207,That's just insane
Taiki Maeda,Would you say that type of environment is characteristic of near market tops
Taiki Maeda,"I mean, of course, for Bitcoin and ETH, you can trade a billion without minimal slippage, but for altcoins, how do you think about timing market tops, identifying bottom signals and whatnot"
CL207,"Yeah, they tend to go on for a while"
CL207,So it could be a bit deceiving
CL207,"But yeah, if every altcoin has so much liquidity, something's wrong"
CL207,"Because at some point, well, I don't really"
CL207,I can't say for every coming cycle
CL207,Maybe this shit is just the norm in the future
CL207,But partly because this bottom so far we have had
CL207,"Like we consolidate here for a year, right"
CL207,"And then you look at like app, like what I would consider absolute vaporware to have multi-billion market cap"
CL207,"And then that's apparently the Pico capitulation bottom, like what the fuck"
CL207,Like that's our society is insane
CL207,"Like, like, like it's just a collective, what, like collective, uh, like pursuit to buy a lottery tickets and degenerate trading"
CL207,"Like, and that, that somehow just holds the market up"
CL207,"I mean, it kind of makes sense for the world to go in this direction"
CL207,So it kind of makes sense
CL207,And there is way less attractiveness to trading Bitcoin than alt
CL207,"So the top could be probably more ridiculous, right"
Taiki Maeda,"Do you actually see value in cryptocurrencies or do you just more see it as a market to trade with all these altist individuals just gambling and degenerating to try to get out of, you know, to get to the next level of wealth, I guess"
CL207,"There is always, yeah, I mean, there is some value in like, but I think a lot more value in the prior statement about"
CL207,"Just trading, yeah"
CL207,"Clearly, just trading"
CL207,It's just a game
CL207,"I mean, there is a lot of value"
CL207,"I saw last cycle where it's very small, by the way"
CL207,"Where a lot of artists I knew and I've commissioned hundreds, they were very open to being paid in stable coins or Bitcoin or ETH"
CL207,That was very fascinating to me
CL207,just much more convenient than PayPal or Wires
CL207,"That was just way more, just yeah"
CL207,"And unironically, fees on a lot of these are actually cheaper than PayPal"
CL207,So that's been good
CL207,"So I mean, there is definitely value in just an asset being globally traded over like, yo, you gotta sign up and be a creditor investor to invest or trade or"
CL207,"And just fully KYC, which, and then, yeah, many people don't want to do all of that"
CL207,"And then if you're not in the US, your access to a lot of these financial instruments are super restricted, right"
CL207,So there is definitely a lot of value in just having this open participation
CL207,"A lot of what we're gambling on, like 80% or more, like 95% is just like hog garbage"
CL207,"It is what it is, I guess"
Taiki Maeda,Do you think it's important to view crypto as a game
Taiki Maeda,"It seems like you were into video games, you mentioned before that you kind of view this market as a game"
Taiki Maeda,Do you think that helps you separate the emotion and the money component to it
Taiki Maeda,Do you think that's really important to be a successful crypto trader
CL207,"Yeah, let's say people that view it as a game, as not real, definitely have done well, but also"
CL207,a lot of these have like lost at all just because like they don't feel like it's real and I used to be way more like that
CL207,but you know if you go outside and just like even buy anything like like like holy crap this is like a fraction of your slippage that's that's just really absurd right like you got to start de-risking at that point um I feel like
CL207,mentally I've de-risked
CL207,"de-risked since end of 2020, early 2021"
CL207,"But prior to that, a lot of the trading I've done are on way more risk"
Taiki Maeda,How much did you start out with
CL207,A few grand
Taiki Maeda,"And in the last, let's say from 2018 to 2021, you've gone to a state where you're comfortable with life, you're traveling"
Taiki Maeda,Do you think like that few thousand to make it is still possible in crypto
Taiki Maeda,"And if so, if someone like retail is watching this video, like how would you recommend, like what do they need to do in order to make it in the next cycle, let's say"
CL207,"Honestly, I don't know, but something I do realize is like, just like how intense the turnover rate is on Twitter in terms of both just people dying out and like alpha where it's like, I see a lot of people posting very valuable stuff that only have like few thousand followers or like 10,000, like, like relatively small, right"
CL207,And then here I am kind of the contributing nothing
CL207,"But like, maybe like three, four or five years ago, I had a bit more to say about like, you know, Bitcoin and DeFi and like buying like, buying Synthetix and Aave at pretty cheap"
CL207,and then longing here and shooting their own youth
CL207,"Like, but I see a lot of, let's just say"
CL207,It's a very different game in these kind of returns
CL207,You can definitely trade on centralized exchange on leverage
CL207,"I would say it's definitely harder than 2019, 2018, that period"
CL207,But it's still definitely doable
CL207,"I would say the main issues like Binance removing liquidation feeds, you don't see the clear picture of liquidation and open interest is delayed by a minute or something"
CL207,"Every time we pump or nuke really fast, you're basically guessing if you should sell or not, or if you should buy or not, which can be deducted, but it's just less obvious, I guess"
CL207,So it's definitely still tradable
CL207,"off centralized exchanges, there's a lot of shit-coining going on where like, I feel like maybe like 20% win and like majority of people just either run into a rug or just like fumble or like just buy the wrong thing"
CL207,"But that game is also just like very complex where it's like, like sometimes when shit-coin really stands out, go from like zero market cap to like 100 mil and it's always pushed by like"
CL207,a lot of what you call influencers and stuff
CL207,"I mean, it is a game you can play"
CL207,I can't think if the odds are better here compared to trading on leverage on centralized
CL207,There is a lot of this kind of stuff going on where I do see people make a lot of sums
CL207,"I do feel like it's honestly, yeah, like for much lower risk, there's a lot of farming stuff you can do, which luckily there wasn't much in my time because I would have probably, I don't know if I would have done that, but maybe I would have"
CL207,"Yeah, so I wouldn't have made as much, but yeah"
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, so let's talk about farming"
Taiki Maeda,"I do run a DeFi channel, and recently there was this new farm"
Taiki Maeda,"And you're an investor in BLAST, this new L2 backed by Paradigm"
Taiki Maeda,"Backed by Paradigm, yeah"
Taiki Maeda,"Yes, backed by Paradigm"
Taiki Maeda,"And right now this BLAST contract, it's not a bridge, it's a contract that has almost, let me refresh this, almost half a billion dollars in TVL"
Taiki Maeda,And this is in a few days
Taiki Maeda,It seems like a lot of people are upset by this
Taiki Maeda,I think it's a pretty good marketing move
Taiki Maeda,"I mean, I think the chain itself makes sense as well"
Taiki Maeda,"Do you mind kind of going over this incentives mechanism, the points thesis you have with loyalty points, marketing"
Taiki Maeda,"Do you think this is where crypto goes eventually, where instead of giving out token rewards, you just give out fake points, and that way you attract capital and try to, I guess, build modes that way"
CL207,"Yeah, I don't think it's worth worth for people to farm this anymore unless you do have a lot of capital, right"
CL207,"And it's like, um, like points, just, they just work like, um, you know, there's like a, like every company use it, right"
CL207,"If they have, if they have a high user base or like audience"
CL207,"It's a great, like both marketing, like it's just, it's a great Ponzi and marketing thing to have"
CL207,"And I do think, yeah, probably more projects are doing it"
CL207,"I mean, they are, like you already see it"
CL207,"I don't, yeah, at half a bill, like, I mean, like, I think the TV goes to like more, so it does reach, it's going to reach a point where like most, it's not going to be worth for most of the people to farm it"
CL207,"Like maybe even me, right"
CL207,It probably is not the ideal farm
CL207,"And there's probably better farms out there, which I probably shall not say for my own sake of dilution"
Taiki Maeda,"Got it, got it"
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, it's crazy"
Taiki Maeda,"I mean, right now, there's a market on AVO, which is like this option slash perpdex, and it's valuing Blast to be 3.6 billion FDB, which is pretty insane, right"
Taiki Maeda,"Like they just spun up this contract, collected half a billion, and now, I mean, albeit like the liquidity profile is like very thin"
Taiki Maeda,There's only like 75k worth of volume
Taiki Maeda,"How do you think, like"
Taiki Maeda,What do you think about these valuation models
Taiki Maeda,What gives L1 and L2's value
Taiki Maeda,"I mean, what gives any token value"
Taiki Maeda,Have you ever thought about that
Taiki Maeda,Is there an answer
Taiki Maeda,"Crypto moves so weird, right"
Taiki Maeda,How do you value these things
Taiki Maeda,How do you think about valuations
CL207,You just move them based on how many people even know about it and how many people give a shit and pay attention to it
CL207,That's pretty much it
CL207,And then something I learned from behavior psych is
CL207,"We always need to have a reason for something, apparently"
CL207,"So every decision we make, there's either a more fact concrete reason, or there is a more social reason"
CL207,"So the fact reason would be like, hey, we are"
CL207,"ABC capital, we took your investor money and we bought Apple shares"
CL207,"And here's our reason, like they make a reason for why they bought Apple shares, right"
CL207,"And then they're like, oh, the revenue is this, their gross projections that like, it's amazing"
CL207,"Like the earning to whatever price, you know, ratio is great"
CL207,We're gonna hold this position
CL207,"And then like, that kind of is like a cult, actually"
CL207,"Like yeah, there is real money"
CL207,"Like at some point it's like too cheap, but like obviously like, like if it's trading at like 1500, like it's, it's, it's pretty much like a game, right"
CL207,"So it's like, even if it goes underwater, I feel like a lot of these funds are like kind of just become a call"
CL207,"They're like, Oh no, we still believe in this"
CL207,"We still, it's like, it's like their Bible, right"
CL207,"It's like, Oh no, we believe in it"
CL207,And then the P is good trust
CL207,"And that's like, they just keep holding it"
CL207,"I was like, yo, what the fuck"
CL207,"Like, and it's kind of the same in here is like"
CL207,"And the more social part of reasoning would be like, hey, you have an iPhone"
CL207,The tech is amazing
CL207,"We got this feature, that feature"
CL207,iPhones are the best
CL207,It's just amazing
CL207,"And then it's like, if you actually look through what they do with their phones, they actually never use 90% of the quote unquote tech they just mentioned"
CL207,"And then it's like, OK, are you really buying this for the tech"
CL207,say something because that's socially acceptable to own an iPhone and socially acceptable to say why an iPhone is superior
CL207,so it's like that's the two main reasoning we give ourselves for our intentions um
CL207,and it's very much the same it's like here where it's like the people make up some whatever metric and be like yo this is why this is valued at this and why it's like gonna go up or down and
CL207,"Or like, yo, GCR bot, so it's now fashionable for me to own a position"
CL207,"Or it's like, oh, Kobe's into, yeah"
CL207,I'm in the trend
CL207,This is the new Balenciaga of the coin to hold for this week
CL207,So it's very similar in that
CL207,"And especially if you're in a Discord group and everyone apes a shitcoin, you kind of know"
CL207,You're probably about to ape that thing
CL207,"Overall, it's just how many people know about it and how many people really care about it"
CL207,"In a sense, that gives valuation to these tokens"
CL207,"And attention is really important now because you could, quote unquote, have amazing tech"
CL207,"If no one talks about it, no one even heard about it, how are they going to buy this coin"
CL207,"we've reached a point of where, in my opinion, social media is kind of like the fundamentals"
CL207,Or like we're getting more and more to that point
CL207,"And then it's like, some people may be like, yo, some protocols actually make money, yo"
CL207,What do you mean
CL207,"And then it's like, yeah, well, if no one talks about us about this on social media, then it never made money"
CL207,Because people won't hear about it and they're not going to buy it
CL207,"But everyone shows like, oh, this protocol makes money"
CL207,"Even if it's not a lot, it's going to the tokens probably going to go up"
CL207,"So, yeah, it's very much just getting to a point of just hyper"
CL207,Influencer like social media ish market
CL207,"Yeah, I would say"
CL207,"Yeah, and I think the GME was actually just like the start of like all of this for triad file like I think like even like common stocks like in"
CL207,"Yeah, maybe not the major stocks, but the mid caps and small caps are definitely going to be moved by a lot of retail in the future too"
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, it's like if a tree falls in the middle of the forest and no one's there to hear it, did it really make a noise"
Taiki Maeda,"If a vertical has good fundamentals but no one knows about it, no one's showing it, is it actually good"
Taiki Maeda,"I guess it's kind of like trading attention, like where attention flows"
Taiki Maeda,"And I got this audience question, ask him about this flows-based approach to markets"
Taiki Maeda,And Jez tweeted about this as well
Taiki Maeda,How would you characterize your trading style
Taiki Maeda,"Like, do you think that, hey, if I expect attention to flow to this coin, it makes sense to front run those flows because more people will talk about it"
Taiki Maeda,You're trading attention
Taiki Maeda,Is that kind of how you would characterize your trading approach
CL207,"Honestly, no, I'm pretty horrible at that actually, which is why I don't dabble so much in the altcoin market"
CL207,"Yeah, I actually mostly just do like big caps and the flows they talk about or I've mentioned that is actually more just like, you know, like if Coinbase is buying on spot and perps are longing on perps, like dude, it's just gonna go up, right"
CL207,So that's the kind of flows I trade
CL207,And I'm a very aggressive trader who does not care about entry with no distinct stop loss
CL207,"But some kind of momentum way to stop loss or time way to stop loss, more so than price one"
CL207,"If spot and purpose are both buying the last hour, I'm just going to buy it"
CL207,"Yeah, I'm buying the top"
CL207,the next hop
CL207,right like so like i'm very aggressive and stuff like that and like if they stop buying then sure you know i'm very i'm very likely looking to like just close out no matter where the price is if it's higher or same or lower
CL207,so that's i guess just like trading momentum honestly but
CL207,"You also do factor in some stuff like, hey, you know, we've, everyone's been buying and longing for like three weeks"
CL207,"You know, if momentum breaks here, it's going to be huge"
CL207,"So then I might jam in on like a reverse, like, you know, no one's bought in like six, like six hours and the open interest and leverages and funding rates are jacking"
CL207,"You know, I'm going to jam on the first, uh, like sell, sell momentum, right"
CL207,"So there's, there's a lot of game to like, like that"
CL207,In terms of flows and then you're kind of just praying the people who've been buying like take some profits or like panic sell or whatever
CL207,"Hey, so that's a lot of the flows I trade"
CL207,And I think jazz is a much better narrative trader than me
CL207,"And most people, honestly, like"
CL207,"I'm the type to think about, oh, Doge could be the next narrative, and then just not even have any exposure"
CL207,"I'm probably not a great altcoin trader, except for DeFi, I guess"
CL207,"That was just very obvious, maybe because the groups I hang out with are more on the funds sides and the retail side"
CL207,Maybe it's more obvious if you talk to 100 non-institutional traders every day
CL207,"I mean, that's a lot of alpha, right"
CL207,"They might start talking about X coin and all of them like, yeah"
CL207,I don't have exposure
CL207,"And then you're like, fuck it"
CL207,I'm just going to long it
CL207,"Like, I don't know what they do honestly"
CL207,"But when I was like, like people whose funds are talking about DeFi, they're like, yo, we can't deploy because there's no liquidity"
CL207,"I'm like, that's so bullish"
CL207,"So, so that's the more like"
CL207,"the stuff I hear about, so I may know a bit more of"
CL207,I do remember the Synthetix Aave trade
CL207,"I was buying Synthetix at like sub $1 and then like every $5,000 USDC buy I made on chain, it was moving the price 2%"
CL207,"And then I was like, wait, I can't even, you know, pack a $50K back then"
CL207,I'm going to move the price up 20%
CL207,"That's ridiculous, right"
CL207,"So you're really, like, really trying to not stop the price too hard"
CL207,Yeah so that was like a very different trading
CL207,and I don't even put too much into like these trades because like I just had no idea if
CL207,"it really does play out or not, although I kind of feel like it almost was definitely what was going to play out"
Taiki Maeda,"You mentioned the DeFi trade, I'm assuming in 2020 was obvious, right"
Taiki Maeda,What made it obvious aside from the fact that maybe at the time your size was in size and you were front running the institutional bid
Taiki Maeda,What did you see in DeFi at the time that made you think that
Taiki Maeda,"Like, wow, this is so obvious"
Taiki Maeda,"I have to buy SNX, Aave, et cetera"
CL207,"It was like pretty much the only thing that was new and shiny and like the only thing people talked about and it's like, it's just ridiculous, right"
CL207,"Like, hey, hey, there's a new smart contract"
CL207,"You put money in, you get some yield here and then you get the token"
CL207,"Now you get the token, you dump it, your yield is now this amount, which is like, let's say like 300%"
CL207,"People thought it was a scam and like they all just kept talking about it and it was just a very strong momentum and attention, right"
CL207,And then it's like
CL207,"oh, now there's some funds deploying some capital"
CL207,We have a big fund
CL207,"Let's slam a mill into this farm, get some risk-free return, unless you get robbed, which I assume some of these funds had a dude who actually can read some code and be like, hey, this seems to be safe or not"
CL207,So a lot of funds started farming DeFi later on
CL207,And that was one of the main things a lot of funds did in 2021
CL207,"But yeah, in 2020, they were just getting started"
CL207,"And yeah, it was pretty much the only new thing where you can leverage on-chain, borrow money on-chain, and then just do this and that, some funny mechanisms where people have never been able"
CL207,do before or they could but there was just like no size at all
CL207,I actually remember I deposited one ETH into Dharma in 2019
CL207,and then I was getting 4% yield
CL207,and I was like you know this is like
CL207,so cool like I can see like this ETH going into the pool and then like actually back then it was like individual pools so if you want to borrow ETH you have to like either find
CL207,someone who's like willing to lend out the same amount or something
CL207,it was it was badly designed I think
CL207,but I can see the exact address I borrowed my ETH
CL207,and I was like yo that's fascinating like I know he has to pay back because like he's gonna get liquidated for a way more amount of USDC if he does not pay back right
CL207,so and that USDC goes back to paying me buying like one ETH and sending it back to me
CL207,so I knew it was safe unless like
CL207,"We really just abruptly sent 100% in one minute with no liquidity to cover, which was not really possible"
CL207,"But yeah, something really insane has to happen for it to work"
Taiki Maeda,"It sounds like in 2019, you were experimenting with things"
Taiki Maeda,"With DeFi, you kind of knew how it worked"
Taiki Maeda,"And then in 2020, more dev devs start to build"
Taiki Maeda,"You start to see actual functioning apps, be it Comp, Aave, et cetera"
Taiki Maeda,"Talking about the present, do you think something has to be new in Chinese for it to pump"
Taiki Maeda,"For example, DeFi seems like a more mature market now"
Taiki Maeda,Do you think there are investment opportunities in DeFi
Taiki Maeda,If you were starting a new account and you're trying to run it up
Taiki Maeda,What sectors do you think has the most amount of opportunity
CL207,"Oh, there's so many sectors now and honestly, I don't really know like half of them to be honest cuz like I guess like if you tell me about games and AI and like Like I just have no idea like Like I feel like games they make some revenue from like, I don't know selling skins or some shit"
CL207,and then it's like
CL207,"Are people buying and then like, I guess you can project something, but AI is just like such a new world to me"
CL207,"Like, I don't know anything about AI, so I'm just not going to talk about it, but some people may actually know something about it"
CL207,"and then they can be like, okay, cool"
CL207,"Uh, this, this, like, I don't know, right"
CL207,"Like they can make some stuff up about, or they may see something like people don't"
CL207,"And then if you believe in that, like AI"
CL207,narrative to have and then sure
CL207,"And then now we have RWAs, which I also don't know about because it's like, I do like the real world"
CL207,Are you serious
CL207,"Like, I thought we were trading, I thought we were trading like magical internet money"
CL207,"Like, what is this real world stuff"
CL207,"Like, that's crazy"
CL207,"yeah, I mean"
CL207,But like I am kind of foolish on it because just like the overall fact that you can just earn yield like yield is like everything yield related to yield and just giving out free money is just foolish right because it's like it's just it's just a meme people have always accepted and like like about like just earning over time
CL207,yeah anything with yield is just it's just good in my opinion it's a good thesis
CL207,"Someone could see something there and be like, okay, this is clearly undervalued"
CL207,I don't want to name or talk too much about specific projects
CL207,"Honestly, I don't even know how safe they are"
CL207,"If you know, then you know"
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, I think DJ and Spartan tweeted this"
Taiki Maeda,"It's like the passive income meme is much more attractive than like hodl, wagme, you know, like that cavale"
Taiki Maeda,"And that's one of the reasons he liked Stake the Ether, real world assets also"
Taiki Maeda,"It's like the yield scales, right"
Taiki Maeda,"Like most DeFi farms, the more TVL goes in, the yield dilutes"
Taiki Maeda,"Like for example, blast"
Taiki Maeda,"But if it's like treasuries or other types of debt, it's like, well, yeah, like billions can enter and the yields still the same"
Taiki Maeda,Do you think like art of A's can be like a sector
Taiki Maeda,people are underestimating
Taiki Maeda,"Like, do you think crypto natives inherently don't like RDAs because it's like, oh, real world, like I love my magic internet money"
Taiki Maeda,"Do you think it's like a sector that people are, like people think that they're overlooking"
CL207,I don't think they're overlooking because like we already have a lot of people talking about it
CL207,"And then it's like, well, like I honestly do not know like what's the exact mechanism people are bringing like, oh, whatever yield from whatever government is like to on-chain"
CL207,"Like there is few forms, the people are also just buying like, oh, like, yeah, hey, our protocol owns like a thousand houses here"
CL207,We're renting them out and this is your passive income
CL207,"And it's like, yeah, what"
CL207,"Like, like, like, like, like out of no clue how legal that is, or like just how ruggable that is, like how safe it is"
CL207,"If you know it's safe and you think it's undervalued, I think then that can be a good play"
CL207,"Also, I feel like part of the meme is not really about us, but a lot of new buyers are going to be a mix of just our generation and then the older generation, which probably prefer something that sounds like something they already know, which is like RWA would be something they kind of know, right"
CL207,I feel like that's also why we've always got a persistent bid
CL207,"It's just like, Hey, we partner with banks"
CL207,"It's complete like scam, but like that sounds so legit, right"
CL207,"So it's like, it's a great Ponzi"
CL207,"Like they just keep saying, yeah, we're, yeah, this bank, yeah, international wire, bro"
CL207,"Like, and it's like, they just get a perm a bit"
CL207,"And it's like, that's, that's just crazy"
Taiki Maeda,"I used to play poker and I was in these poker discords and there's like this one guy was so adamant that like XRP wasn't hit $1,000 and nothing could shake his confidence on that"
Taiki Maeda,And they're like people that
Taiki Maeda,I have no idea
CL207,How many years has it been
CL207,Does he still think it's going to a thousand
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, for sure"
Taiki Maeda,What the fuck
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, I mean, I guess it's partly crypto YouTube and whatnot, right"
Taiki Maeda,"You mentioned earlier the crypto markets are more and more influenced, I guess by influencers, because people's source of truth are whatever"
Taiki Maeda,people see on the internet
Taiki Maeda,Do you think that's healthy for the markets or do you think it's a natural evolution of this eternally online society that it seems like the younger generation is becoming a part of
CL207,"Yeah, I think it is"
CL207,"And I think at some point it is going to be really, really bad to get to a point where it's just so bad that we try to find another system that helps it get better again, which is why I was so"
CL207,just into some kind of rep system
CL207,"Even AI is getting really good, right"
CL207,"So it's like, yo, if we can't even distinguish a celebrity between, are they even real"
CL207,"We can't even tell, right"
CL207,"Because it's like, especially in this industry, it's completely acceptable at this point that you're just some character"
CL207,"So if there's some weird cartoon character animal that's screaming out tickers and they just keep pumping, if they're an AI"
CL207,they're going to be like the overlord of like a corner of Twitter where like they can just keep influencing the market
CL207,"And then it's like, or just like way more like of these like bought it accounts or like fishing, like scam and like, does that just like scam people, right"
CL207,"Just tweet links, DM people, random like promotion stuff"
CL207,"Yeah, I can see it getting pretty bad"
CL207,and it's really hard
CL207,to for like one entity to filter all of these out because like if there is a rule like on like on the internet i feel like it's or just like overall like i feel like you there is like a way around it so it's just like
CL207,hey we did this implementation to like get out get the bots out
CL207,and then like you you have like a million team of like
CL207,people who just want to like code some BS bot to like scam some money like it's like no risk but full return
CL207,right so it's like it's such a great thing to do uh if you're just if you just don't care about like ethics and uh just want to make money
CL207,right um so you got all these smart people that's just gonna find what the rules are and just spend around it and just keep you know buying social media accounts and
CL207,like going for it um i think it will get pretty bad and then like
CL207,a rep system where like if everyone if every like actual living being participate in it then it's it becomes much more harder for like a bot to really infiltrate although that's obviously at the cost of like the entire society putting time into into this and um
CL207,although in real life the entire society do put time into this which is why i thought it could kind of work because like like if we meet and like
CL207,"a group of friends of me, they might talk about, hey, that guy, I don't trust him because he did this and that"
CL207,"Words spread, right"
CL207,"But it doesn't spread as easily here, I feel like"
CL207,"Or people just forget, forget, because these posts get buried in a week or month"
CL207,Or people just restart an identity
CL207,It's really easy to restart an identity
CL207,But it's hard for an identity to really stay and get really big
Taiki Maeda,"So I mean, with like the rep system, um, I think you wrote a blog post around friend tech, like I think recently, like the keys have come down across the board"
Taiki Maeda,"Are you still bullish friend tech or like, where do you think it goes from here"
CL207,"I always saw a friend tech was a mix of just like a mix of both rep and something else, a bit of like how much, how active you are or like how"
CL207,much ETH are you spending kind of and then like and then there's like a bit of Ponzi where there's three three going on and then there's a bit of like actual utility where it's like
CL207,okay i can buy this like maybe there's like i would say maybe there's actually at least five good traders on the platform where you know there's genuinely uh like a justifiable lifetime price to pay for um
CL207,i i don't really need that because like
CL207,it's really hard for me to trade off other people's opinions
CL207,Kind of like if you log into someone else's trading account
CL207,"and you see like five positions, you don't really know why they're open, where they think it's gonna go, like you have no clue how to manage these from that point on, right"
CL207,"So it's kind of the same where it's like, okay, this guy said this goes up, okay, by how much, I don't know"
CL207,"Or like if they say by how much, I don't know man, like it's just like"
CL207,It's just not your trade
CL207,So it's like really hard for you to have a conviction in it
CL207,"And then like, it might draw, draw down a bit and you might panic, but like if that guy have way more conviction, then you, he might hold and he might be right"
CL207,"So it's like, a lot of this is like really hard to, for me at least"
CL207,"So I don't really do that, but, but on"
CL207,There is some value there
CL207,"And then a bit of like influence and uh, but"
CL207,"Overall, I still really like the platform, to be honest"
CL207,I've met a lot of people there
CL207,And part of it was actually just me buying a bunch of accounts that are of the Asian community
CL207,And I bought some Middle Eastern people
CL207,"And then they're like, hey, yo, if you want to get into my homies group chat, here's a link"
CL207,And then I joined these chats
CL207,And it's really cool just to see what you're talking about
CL207,"I thought that was like probably like, obviously, it's not worth like what how much I spent like, I'm not gonna say"
CL207,but that was still at least something came out of it
CL207,It wasn't just like I bought like a scam and then they went to zero
CL207,I'm still quite happy with how it played out so far
CL207,"Yeah, although yeah, like"
CL207,"It could be better, but yeah, not complaining"
CL207,"I hope the points are worth something, but we still don't know at this point"
Taiki Maeda,"You mentioned earlier, if someone talks about their trade or you see someone's trade, it's really hard to build a conviction because you don't know why they put on a trade and you don't know their time horizon"
Taiki Maeda,"It seems like crypto, Twitter, and CT, it seems like people just throw out tickers and say it's going to go up and whatnot"
Taiki Maeda,"As a valuable member of the CTE community, how would you recommend an average person utilize crypto Twitter"
CL207,"Yeah, that's another problem"
CL207,"It takes a lot of time to get good at this, as in to even know what you're reading is like how legit this guy is"
CL207,"I feel like as you spend time on this website, you kind of subconsciously build like a kind of like how legit they are score"
CL207,And then they are like a
CL207,"OK, this guy's not very good"
CL207,But this guy's pretty good
CL207,So I think it's pretty innate
CL207,Most people probably kind of have a sense of how to use it
CL207,"But yeah, I would just say, yeah"
CL207,I guess just find people and see if they're like
CL207,"I mean, a lot of their tweets can be backtested"
CL207,"And then it's like, a lot of accounts do delete tweets"
CL207,But I feel like it could be pretty obvious
CL207,"You follow them, too"
CL207,"And I would definitely always make your own decision, just because that's how you actually really get good at something, not from listening to others"
Taiki Maeda,"So first of all, like I really appreciate you taking the time, but I'll try to get into the rapid fire question section"
Taiki Maeda,"So you mentioned earlier, and this was surprising to me"
Taiki Maeda,"You know, you, your biggest, I guess, win was like two to 300k and you typically don't try to hold like hold trades for a couple of days to a couple of weeks"
Taiki Maeda,Like why is that
Taiki Maeda,Like haven't there been high conviction trades that you don't mind holding for months at a time
Taiki Maeda,"Or do you, is that like more your trading style, your personality"
Taiki Maeda,You want to talk about that
CL207,"Yeah, I think it's a bit of both where it's like, I tend to find it hard"
CL207,"I mean, like everyone's different"
CL207,"But it's hard for me to have conviction on something that's just like a higher time frame, just because the uncertainty just gets bigger and bigger as more time there is for you to guess what's going to happen"
CL207,"So even when Bitcoin was breaking out of like 12 to 16 to 20 K, like I was pretty sure all of that was going to happen, but like I could only hold a position to like 16, for example, right"
CL207,Cause like I knew like I'd retrace would come and then it's much harder for me to mentally read long like 15 K
CL207,"It's like, bro, I've never longed my whole life"
CL207,"I like my two years of two, three years of trading so far has been a Bitcoin is like five K, eight K, you know, like 15 is crazy"
CL207,"I think it takes some skill to adjust to that but, and like I should have thought about, like yo, this is a time where you do not think about what the fuck the price is when you're longing"
CL207,"Like you sold 16, it's time to rebuy 15 if you think it's going to 20, right"
CL207,"But I didn't rebuy the size I want, but also just like if you're on like some form of leverage, which I was, then"
CL207,it's really hard to hold a position from 12 to 16 and then just keep holding even though you know like we're gonna like wait to like 14 or 15 just from like some profit taking and then it's like like you get you got to hold that for like a week two weeks like that's crazy like like it's really hard to sleep it's really hard to do a lot of things where like and then you just have like a massive mental block on your head where it's like
CL207,"I have a ridiculously sized position on this magic internet money, which I think is going to 20k, but I know for this week it might scam me"
CL207,"So like, like it's just like, you're going to suffer for that, like, like 10 days to like, uh, I'm very much of like a life maximalist where it's like, or happy maximalist where it's like, Hey, you know, just"
CL207,"Yeah, I do not want to win more"
CL207,Just get me out of this stress
CL207,"So I'm more of that kind of, yeah"
Taiki Maeda,"Nice, nice, nice"
Taiki Maeda,What do you think are common traits of successful traders
Taiki Maeda,"I mean, obviously you have a bunch of friends who are amazing traders"
Taiki Maeda,"We've seen people blow up, come and go"
Taiki Maeda,Do you want to talk about what makes someone successful when it comes to investing or trading with them
CL207,"Obviously, good risk management"
CL207,And most people I know do really well are pretty humble
CL207,"And then the not-so-humble ones tend to go bigger, but I've seen them draw down also much more"
CL207,"Yeah, just get ego, being humble, get at risk, having the ability to know you're wrong"
CL207,the ability to think you can be wrong and you're not invincible or just know everything
CL207,I think that's really good
Taiki Maeda,"You mentioned risk management, but it seems like you like to turn up the leverage up, right"
Taiki Maeda,And sometimes you can't get good sleep and whatnot
Taiki Maeda,"What are your risk management, I guess, rules"
Taiki Maeda,What are some rules you live by when it comes to trading on leverage
CL207,"Well, usually I always maybe set my positions"
CL207,"I might play a game of League or two, but I can still tap out and be like, OK, it's not necking to zero right now, or going to infinity where I'm short"
CL207,"But overall, mine's just very momentum-based, or just kind of just monetary-based"
CL207,"If I'm down six fakes, I'm definitely looking to cut, even if I think it's going to bounce in favor of my position, just because I tend to have this system where"
CL207,"If I'm wrong by that much margin, then I do not deserve to be breakeven to begin with, even if I think it's going to like, uh, retrace to my entry immediately or something"
CL207,"Um, so this, I guess this, this part of trading is where I see as a game and not like real money"
CL207,"Some of the, some of the trading stuff I do is not definitely not very, um, I guess like just perfect EV or something"
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, like do you think that the majority of your trades are more gut feel driven just because you're just always staring at the charts"
Taiki Maeda,You kind of know how these markets move
Taiki Maeda,"Yeah, like how important is gut feel to you"
CL207,That's pretty good amount
CL207,"And then there's always kind of like a, a feel of like, we're like a price level ish"
CL207,"I mean, it's pretty obvious where like people get liquidated and stuff, but"
CL207,"Yeah, there's also a gut feel of how bad that move is going to get if we go to this level or that level, right"
CL207,Because I feel like the data is not as transparent
CL207,You kind of have to take some leaps of assumptions where I think
CL207,"If we dipped 5% here, we utterly fucked because that destroys everyone on x20 leverage, which is pretty common, honestly, for this market to have"
CL207,"And then it's like, if you also assume a lot of positions are open and high leveraging around the same price, we've been consolidating"
CL207,"And then if we move against all these positions, they're going to have to close"
CL207,And then that's going to cause probably way more moves in percentage-wise
CL207,"And then, yeah, so those kind of gut feels are pretty"
CL207,"It's both a guffier and somewhat quantitative, I guess, in a sense"
Taiki Maeda,"So you mentioned you're a momentum trader, and you might be at the top, but you're going to long"
Taiki Maeda,"Do you have any examples of recent trades that you've taken, whether it be Bitcoin, ETH, Solana, things like that, where you've used that system"
CL207,And how did that turn out for you
CL207,"Earlier today, Bitcoin was at 30%"
CL207,and I just thought and that's like the highest spin in like I don't know a week or so
CL207,and then I just sold at 38 flat um
CL207,so I mean that's just like pure momentum
CL207,and then yeah didn't make a ton on it maybe like 10k
CL207,I I don't trade a lot anymore
CL207,but like today I'm home
CL207,and I kind of saw
CL207,like like okay the
CL207,The momentum is just crazy
CL207,It's definitely going to test 38 somehow
CL207,It seems like you go off vice
CL207,"I mean, this is just such intraday BS stuff going on"
CL207,"Honestly, not even worth talking about, but yeah"
Taiki Maeda,"So a few more questions, then I'll let you go"
Taiki Maeda,What are some biggest misconceptions about the crypto markets that you see online
CL207,"Oh, I love the, they are going to dump it or like they are going to put the price"
CL207,"It's like, who, who's they bro"
CL207,"Like they, like they do not exist"
CL207,"You know, like there is no like God in this market"
CL207,"That's like, yeah, they're protecting it or like they're going to like send it"
CL207,I feel like that's like some misconception people have
CL207,There is just like a lot of fucking rich kids and a lot of fucking rich people in general
CL207,Like that's in this right
CL207,"they're all, they all love to gamble and they're all gambling alongside you"
CL207,"So it's like, and you might not know why they're buying and selling"
CL207,"So it's like, when price don't react to some news, like, Hey, why didn't we dump"
CL207,Like there's such bad news
CL207,Like the person buying might not even know what's going on
CL207,They just wanted to buy and fuck off
CL207,"Like, like some, some things can not just be, can just not be explained"
CL207,"And like, you don't have to think it's like some weird, like"
CL207,"Like they, that's influencing the market"
Taiki Maeda,I think it's normal for humans
Taiki Maeda,"Maybe you don't understand because you're a cat, but I think every human wants to rationalize why something has happened"
Taiki Maeda,"But sometimes the markets move and you just have to react, right"
Taiki Maeda,So final question I have for you
Taiki Maeda,"I have a lot of viewers, they're listening to this podcast and they want to make it"
Taiki Maeda,How do you think an average retail trader can make it next cycle
Taiki Maeda,"Do you have any life lessons, life alpha that you want to share"
CL207,Oh my God
CL207,"This is always the hardest question because it's like, what do you say to help like all these people get rich"
CL207,I do not know
CL207,"I'm trying to, it's pretty hard for me to get richer myself"
CL207,"Like, like, honestly, I do feel like bigger accounts are overrated, small accounts are underrated on average"
CL207,And then I think
CL207,There's a lot of alpha in these like on-chain traders and a bunch of the smaller centralized exchange traders where not many people are following as much just because like they don't ship posts as often
CL207,"And then, yeah, I think a lot of big accounts are pretty like just overrated in general"
CL207,"They do have a lot of say in like just momentum of ship points because like, I mean, you know, if like everyone"
CL207,over a hundred K follower tweeted a ticker like bro that's just gonna send right
CL207,but like like a like a smaller account may be talking about stuff that that's that's less just like less aggressive but actually like kind of valuable
CL207,or it could be talking about something that big accounts catch on later
Taiki Maeda,"So would you say that maybe this obscure coin just like pumped a lot, um, for whatever reason, maybe is it like worth maybe going on Twitter, looking up the ticker, identify some accounts that talked about it before, um, and then try to network with them, talk to them"
Taiki Maeda,"Uh, is that like, do you think how important is like networking"
Taiki Maeda,Do you think
CL207,Networking is amazing
CL207,"I mean, like you, you can, like a lot of these group chats, they're not exclusive at all"
CL207,"They're just like, yo, if you're, if you're just like a nice guy out there"
CL207,And you're cool
CL207,People are just going to add you to a bunch of random chats
CL207,They may be good
CL207,They may just be playing games
CL207,"But eventually, you make friends with them"
CL207,And some of the bets they take do make money
CL207,"And it's like, or you just all get rocked together"
CL207,I don't know
CL207,"I think a lot of the small cancer out there, especially, maybe been around"
CL207,for a wall like if they survived like all the FTX and like all the rugs and implosions Luna never holding a single UST like they're pretty smart
CL207,right like so I feel like or not if they're not smart at least they're good at risk so like the chances of you like like if you can get in touch with like a group of these friends or like a like smaller people on Twitter I think that's pretty
CL207,Pretty fucking good
CL207,and it's like you don't have to be like following the big accounts like I like even for me like I don't feel like I tweet much saying stuff useful for you guys or they say for anyone right like maybe apart from like
CL207,hey I think Bitcoin eats the bands
CL207,and it's like someone with this size may have a more opinion like some opinion or actionable thing to do
CL207,but like I I don't feel like a lot of stuff I say are very
Taiki Maeda,"Actually, the last thing I wanted to talk about, this is just pure shit posting, but I asked on Twitter if people have any questions and an overwhelming majority of them, let me try to pull this up actually, they're asking about unisocs"
Taiki Maeda,"So you have this meme where you're just like jerking off the unisocs, right"
Taiki Maeda,Like what's the origin behind that
Taiki Maeda,And how many shots can a unisoc hold
CL207,"So I remember just like one day I came across this shitcoin worth $3,000, $4,000, $5,000"
CL207,And it's just like this sock from Uniswap
CL207,"And I was like, okay, this, like, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever fucking seen my whole life, right"
CL207,"Like the ETH was at like 1k back then, or like, no, no, no"
CL207,ETH was at 200 and this shit was at 5k
CL207,"Cause like, this was like 2020, right"
CL207,And it pumped because every sock holder was going to get like the uni airdrop
CL207,So it pumped to 10k
CL207,Everyone bought it
CL207,"And then like, it just stayed at like 3, 4k for a long time"
CL207,"And I was just like, I bought like 10"
CL207,gave five out for free
CL207,and I was like yo this is just absurd I feel like and just how absurd the fact that it was at 5k kind of just made it keep going up
CL207,and now it's just holding at 40 I mean and that itself is just fucking ridiculous
CL207,right like why the fuck do people hold this I don't fucking know which is why I'm holding it
CL207,I mean it's just for fun like
CL207,I don't know if it goes much higher
CL207,I don't think many people hold it to dump
CL207,So I don't think it goes too much lower
CL207,"But again, I don't know who the fuck would buy this"
CL207,"So it's just probably going to maintain at some value all the time, just because it's ridiculous"
Taiki Maeda,"You're avoiding the original question, man"
Taiki Maeda,How much cum can a Unisoc hold if a Unisoc can't hold cum
Taiki Maeda,That's the original question
CL207,Some questions are better left unasked for the sake of our industry
Taiki Maeda,"OK, for the sake of our industry"
Taiki Maeda,We'll keep that a secret
Taiki Maeda,"All right, all right"
Taiki Maeda,I think we'll wrap it up there
Taiki Maeda,We'll let the audience kind of simmer on that question
Taiki Maeda,And we'll leave it to their imagination
Taiki Maeda,"Thank you, CL"
Taiki Maeda,Do you have any final words for our audience today
CL207,"No, not really"
CL207,"All right, all right, all right"
Taiki Maeda,"All right, thanks, Kat"
Taiki Maeda,"Talk to you later, man"
