speaker,text
Host,"OK, I think we're live"
Host,This is still the coolest slash weirdest thing I think we've had on one of these sessions
Host,I think the chat can see it as well
Host,But we've got CL in the form that we know and love him
Host,"And apparently, this is some pretty sophisticated tech, right"
Host,It tracks your face
Host,Do you want to explain what I'm looking at before I have to do it to a police officer or something
CL207,Sounds like this
CL207,It's just called VQ
CL207,"It's just a normal camera, but you install this app"
CL207,There's several of them
CL207,I'm using Facebook
CL207,"It's just like, observe your face muscles and stuff, and just telegraph that onto whatever model you have"
CL207,"And the artists who made the model, they have to kind of also"
CL207,"Like, they have to input, like, okay, what part of this face is, like, this cat's muscle is going to move if the human starts moving, or stuff like that"
CL207,so it works
Host,"So when the cat's ears move, are those your ears moving, like, in real life"
CL207,"No, no, no"
CL207,"That one's like, that's an automaker animation"
CL207,"I figured, yeah"
Host,"So it's the mouth and eyes mostly, right"
CL207,"Yeah, pretty much"
CL207,I think it's pretty neat because it allows anonymous people to interact more
CL207,"I don't have my hand as a part of this model, but people can do hand face emotional gestures"
Host,That's just really cool
Host,We might need to look into this
CL207,"I was just about to say, I'm actually down to try it"
CL207,I don't know if anyone would want to
Host,the chat likes it more without camera or not
Host,but I like with that kind of thing I would do it
Host,it's one of those things you'll never be able to explain or justify in the future like looking back on those videos like right now can you imagine looking at this video in two years
Host,like hi we're here with CL there's like a cat in a spacesuit and we're talking to him about cryptocurrency futures there's like clearly something just that's that's not gonna
Host,not gonna look good in in whatever number of years but whatever i'm here for it speaking of trying things you should also try Blockfolio the sponsor of technical roundup you can track your portfolio but even better in times like these you can actually hide your portfolio so you don't have to be exposed to the fact that you're all in altcoins and you're not having a great time
Host,So lots of options there
Host,Check them out
Host,Get the mobile app
Host,I'm going to buy some more shit coins for my family members soon
Host,Maybe we'll ask at the end what I should buy for them
Host,Although I do want to stay part of the family
Host,So that'd be a helpful precursor
Host,Now this is pretty casual
Host,So we normally for like our podcast stuff
Host,"We prepare like a full list of questions, go through it etc etc"
Host,"This is Casual Friday so it's a bit more casual as the name suggests but you're like a lot of your tweets are focused around futures and debunking certain things, explaining others, commentary around premier, open interest, all that type of stuff and we all know that people only learn how futures work like"
Host,after they get wrecked
Host,"At least in 2017, you know, you made money in the bull market, and then you got like the chop bear market, whatever"
Host,"And people started trading on BitMEX, essentially, that was the new crack then after altcoins had their fun"
Host,"And then after you lost everything there, then you're like, okay, maybe I should figure out how this kind of thing works"
Host,"And Don, I don't know if you want to speak to this, but you conducted a couple of polls recently about futures as the sat start"
Host,What do you how do you think those went
CL207,"It wasn't necessarily about futures and stuff, it was just understanding, leverage and that kind of stuff"
CL207,"I'm not surprised that people got it wrong, because most people did"
CL207,What I'm more surprised about is that people are really angry actually
CL207,I got so much shit for that
CL207,"So the question was basically, if I remember correctly, was something akin to"
CL207,one guy buys like $50 worth of Bitcoin and the other one buys like $100 worth of Bitcoin
CL207,And it was just basically using the leverage as in like the one guy that bought 100 did it without leverage and the one that bought like 50 did it with like 2x leverage
CL207,And people just got it completely wrong
CL207,"They were like, okay, well like 4x leverage, the second guy"
CL207,"But they were like, okay, adding it up and it was basically just"
CL207,"They weren't really understanding how leverage works, which is like, you don't necessarily like when you're saying like, I bought this with 4X leverage, that doesn't have to mean that you just bought your entire balance and then 4X it whatever"
CL207,"Yeah, it's not how it works"
CL207,"But I mean, I'm not surprised about that"
CL207,"Most people just don't read this stuff, like the documentation on the exchanges"
CL207,"But like I said, I'm surprised that people like are so ambivalent, is that the right word"
CL207,To like learn how it actually works and instead just got angry with me instead
Host,"Yeah, it's quite easy to get angry with you there, to be fair"
Host,You're a good hacky sack to kick around between the community for fun
Host,"Because we all know you've been mega bearish since 10k and missed the entire bull market, as I learned this morning reading the comments section, right"
Host,So I guess you deserve a bit of criticism for that
CL207,"Yeah, I mean, fair"
Host,"Ciel, what's your take on the average understanding of the crypto futures market or just derivatives generally"
CL207,"Actually, I've never thought about that"
Host,Is it like a they're not going to make it type of thing
Host,Or do you engage with people who post misinformation
Host,"Because you clarify a lot of stuff, a lot of your commentary about stablecoin versus Bitcoin margin futures"
Host,You're sometimes just replying to stuff and adding your own kind of takes
Host,Have you ever considered
Host,"Are you impressed, I guess, with the community"
CL207,"I mean, yeah"
CL207,"yeah, a lot of them just have no idea what they're talking about"
CL207,"But like, I don't really like engage with everyone"
CL207,"But like, if it's someone I know, then I do like answer about it"
CL207,"And it's like, yeah"
Host,"We'll all be gigabrained after today, though"
Host,I don't know where you want to start
Host,"We could start with some futures stuff, with some commentary you made recently, or you could just tell us what you think about the market, and then maybe your argument will be based on whatever, a lack of a significant premium, funding, whatever it may be"
Host,Which way do you want to take it
Host,"It's casual, so the floor is yours"
CL207,"Just any, but I guess adding to what you actually just told me, I guess a lot of people don't think twice about"
CL207,like what they're seeing
CL207,"Like, say, oh, this phenomena happened"
CL207,I don't know
CL207,"Like, say, oh, suddenly this one exchange is extremely negative funding, or another exchange has super weird CBD going on"
CL207,And then I feel like it's pretty important
CL207,"You actually do go to that exchange, check out the trading history"
CL207,like basically find out like what caused it because like like just general understanding of what's happening is pretty important I think if you're only trading right like because like then you know
CL207,okay if if you see that signature happen again then you kind of know like what's going on
CL207,so it's like
CL207,I think a pretty
CL207,"Good thing I did early on was like every any time I saw like something some sort of like data happened, which I was not sure like why was happening"
CL207,I kind of just like scared at it for hours seeing it going on
Host,"In terms of like those data points, what specifically do you look at"
Host,"Like if someone has no idea what you're referring to when you say data, is it like the coinilize stuff or like what's your toolkit"
Host,Do you want to give some context
Host,"And Doug, feel free to jump in as well"
CL207,"Like, yeah, I remember like in end of 2020, no, sorry, end of 20, I'm thinking like we'll be about to head into 2020"
CL207,"I remember these Asian exchanges, they had futures that were way more backward than the ones on BitMax"
CL207,"And then I was like, OK, isn't it free money"
CL207,"You sell BitMax by a whole, but you sell BitMax by OKX"
CL207,"And I was like, OK, what caused this"
CL207,Why did this happen
CL207,I think it would be safe to assume there was a bigger seller
CL207,"Ideally, you do find out if that's actually the case, right"
CL207,"So like, yeah, I think price was like at 7K"
CL207,and then some really big shorts were opening on these Asian exchanges
CL207,"And yeah, like I was checking the open interest there and it was just like 50, 60 or like 70 mill worth of shorts, like just pushing the market down"
CL207,"So like, yeah"
CL207,"And like that made, I remember at that time, Quobi and OKX"
CL207,they had like March futures that were like hundreds of dollars below Bitmax
CL207,"And at 7,000, $6,000, like a couple hundred dollars is pretty big percentage wise, right"
CL207,"So it's like, yeah"
CL207,"So that was like, yeah, just an example of like dislocation and why you should figure out what happened"
CL207,"And yeah, actually later on, I think that short got liquidated on the way up at 8,600 and that pushed like"
CL207,the premium significantly above Bitmax
CL207,"So you could have bought into his shorts and sold it back to him, basically opposite end of the premiums"
CL207,And basically you could have hedged that to you through Bitmax
CL207,And that would have just been a sick arbitrage
CL207,How do you take advantage of that
CL207,Did you take advantage back then
CL207,I remember seeing that guy like gigashort and then like BIMX started shorting too because like all the crips and like future data like futures are also like basically they were all negative so I was like
CL207,yeah screw this like you're not allowed to be like disparish on this asset
CL207,"so I started longing like around like 6,800 all the way down to like 64 and luckily we did bottom"
CL207,so I guess that was just like buying the dip
Host,"Was that you shorting, Don"
Host,Does you remember that from
Host,"People, when you talk about like, I mean, even just like the basic language, long, short"
Host,"whatever, one of the most common bits of futures commentary"
Host,"And I think one of, again, one of the sources of confusion is like long to short ratios, right"
Host,"So people will look at these ratios and specifically the, usually the bit for next ones, but other bits of data as well"
Host,and a kind of eyeball test understanding will be the oh there are more shorts than longs therefore the market bet is bearish or therefore they're gonna get squeezed whatever now that ratio is really always one-to-one but people still come to certain conclusions based on the long short ratio I mean what is that ratio do you use it for anything are people completely misunderstanding the the the whole one-to-one thing all right
CL207,"Technically, it is one-to-one, right"
CL207,"Say right now, I market long a Bitcoin, and then I'm buying it from probably the market maker, right"
CL207,"So the market maker is now short a Bitcoin, because he just allowed me to buy the other side of the contract"
CL207,And then imagine this
CL207,"The market maker now, he's short one Bitcoin"
CL207,"some sort of trading desk and be like, yo, can we have like one Bitcoin to borrow"
CL207,"And for like, say, very low APR, probably like 1% or something pretty low, right"
CL207,"Because like, yeah, like Bitcoin doesn't get much yield because the short demand is not like, extreme, right"
CL207,"Like, so they borrow a Bitcoin, they sell it on spot, their position is like totally dealt in neutral, they're chilling, they have a ton of collateral, the market maker is happy"
CL207,And you're on leverage
CL207,And you're watching your P&L flash nonstop
CL207,And you have a liquidation price
CL207,So who's actually taking the risk here
CL207,It's not the market maker
CL207,You're the one taking the directional risk
CL207,"So if everyone's taking that kind of risk, you can say every contract is valid and stuff"
CL207,"who are the one pressure to sell actually, right"
CL207,It's obviously the one that are taking the risk
CL207,"So like, yeah, if price start moving down, I'll be the one selling and because I don't want to be liquidated, right"
CL207,So then I would sell my Bitcoin and that causes the price to drop more
CL207,"So essentially like, yeah, technically it's one to one, but the amount of risk these participants are taking are definitely not one to one"
CL207,"You have to think which side of the market are the riskier bets being made, because usually it goes against them"
CL207,"And it's not just because, oh, they all have to lose"
CL207,"It's just the nature of this force where it's like, OK, if majority of the degenerate people are longing, and then say price just moves down a little bit"
CL207,a few of them are pressured to close
CL207,"That just makes the price drop more, which causes the medium risk of people to close, which in turn then, say, causes the price to drop even more"
CL207,And then that then hits the even lower risk people
CL207,"So it's kind of like, yeah, if all the degenerate are on one side, it's kind of inevitable that some sort of cascade snowballs against them"
CL207,I don't know if that makes sense
Host,"Duck, what do you think"
Host,Do you pay attention to these ratios or do you look at other stuff
Host,"I mean, what do you do in terms of futures data"
Host,I know you look at funding
CL207,"I mean, funding is like a good indicator in that regard, goes in the same direction, I would say"
CL207,"But I mean, what I usually do, like I hang out in discourse"
CL207,and I hang out in like in chat rooms
CL207,"And then I have people like CL and people like other people that look at the same data basically, and they keep spamming about it"
CL207,"So I actually know like how it's looking like most of the time, even if I'm not looking at it"
CL207,So I don't even have to like actively look at it if I want to know about it
Host,So your secretaries give you the breakdown of the future
Host,You don't even have to have anything open
CL207,"No, but like it doesn't affect like funding affects my trading"
CL207,"I don't really like go much, much deeper than that"
CL207,"I think funding is more than plenty, but I always appreciate like more of an insight"
CL207,"And then when I'm like, okay, this is that support and I see negative funding and I see like people really turning bearish"
CL207,"Then I'm like, okay, it's probably going to bounce"
CL207,And then I go to my trusty friends that know more about the leverage aspect of it and who's short and who's long and how the market's looking and ask them
CL207,"And then if they agree with me, I mean, that's usually good confidence to have"
Host,"See, there's negative funding always bullish, slash a guarantee of some sort of short squeeze, because we've had periods on the way down where futures get hammered, funding is negative and stays there, but then we don't see people just call for reversal simply based on the fact that funding is negative, and sometimes it just kind of moves sideways and then moves down again"
Host,When does it make sense to position bullishly for negative funding
Host,"Or maybe alternatively, in what context would you or maybe wouldn't you buy those long liquidations"
Host,Do you kind of see what I'm getting at
CL207,"Right, so negative funding doesn't mean it's net-shorted, right"
CL207,"Because the per basis is live, right"
CL207,It can be hammered down temporarily just because lungs are Rushing out
CL207,"So so like yeah, we've seen a quite a bit of negative funding for like Let's see"
CL207,"Yeah, like the first two days after You know like May 19 we had negative funding and we bounced to 40, but we started nuking on negative funding again"
CL207,So why is that
CL207,So it's like like my interpretation of it is like
CL207,you have you've had like three four months of just like all these lungs trying to buy more and they and I like I knew was unhealthy but like it was hard to tell when it will fully get white right because they it's
CL207,you just can't never tell because they can
CL207,And I guess that Elon Fudd did it
CL207,"But yeah, you had multiple months of longs accumulating in a range"
CL207,And then they suddenly want to all get out within a few days
CL207,"So there is this liquidity crisis where it's like, OK, why would I long"
CL207,Why should you be longing
CL207,Why would you buy someone else's long
CL207,Why should we bail them out
CL207,They must either sell it to us at way cheaper prices
CL207,a ton of negative funding then like
CL207,yeah you get some you get like incentives too for people to like start
CL207,like yeah we can buy out these trapped longs but like otherwise like all these all these months worth of like lungs opened above like the range they were just getting out
CL207,like we just had like multiple days of like that
CL207,and and now that open interest has like pretty much settled like like as in like okay
CL207,"Yeah, I don't think there's like much overhang in terms of like, in terms of like old long positions anymore"
CL207,"So I think now it's like, negative funding, if sustained, like would mean more"
CL207,"And, and sometimes you see negative funding, like, say, intraday, or like, interweek, like we get negative funding for just one day, but then you also, at the same time, you go to like, the three months futures and like the rates are like 20 30%"
CL207,"And you're like, okay, so the average lending rate is still positive 20% for the next few months"
CL207,So why should you assume the market has no loans left
CL207,"That just doesn't make sense, right"
CL207,The PIRP can get into negative funding just based on lack of liquidity for a lot of loans to exit in a short period
CL207,"But yeah, people should really be watching the multi-month futures"
CL207,"especially the ones on like FTX, Huobi and like I think Binance is also getting more liquid"
CL207,"but yeah these are like the most liquid interest rate markets in crypto and like and that's like way more determinative of like the sentiment, at least I think so"
CL207,"I mean, in my eyes, it's just like when you have like negative funding and support, right"
CL207,"It's just like buying gets cheap, right"
CL207,"You can just I mean, it's you know, that like a bunch of people are selling into you basically below price"
CL207,"And I mean, it just makes it a little bit more attractive"
CL207,Like I wouldn't say negative funding and just buy this
CL207,That doesn't make any sense
CL207,"But it's like, if you like"
CL207,want to buy anyway
CL207,and you're just waiting for something and you get negative funding for a day or two then you're probably gonna or like even you've had negative funding for the down move i mean it just makes sense to bounce in my in my eyes it's less sophisticated
CL207,but i mean for me it works
CL207,like like few days ago when we dropped like 32 31 um like like
CL207,"Not only like all the curbs went negative, like the end of June futures were pretty negative too, so that was a pretty good, relatively easy buy"
Host,This actually brings a good point into a tweet that you made
Host,It was about the JP Morgan strategists kind of lapping
Host,And it was this article from Bloomberg
Host,"And the bit that's highlighted says, strategists say Bitcoin futures backwardation is a bearish sign"
Host,"And then you pointed out, of course, that you basically posted this chart"
Host,"And you highlighted every time that basis got to 0%, all the futures were backwardated over the last 2.2 and 1.5 years"
Host,uh and they've all been very kind of either bottom or bullish continuation trades
Host,so if we start from step one so what is contango or backwardation and then i guess the second point do you want to elaborate on the point of is that a goodbye signal as opposed to a goodbye signal
Host,yeah it's definitely not like
Host,yeah you need to like leverage all then like mortage or anything but like
CL207,"It just means people's future expectation of price appreciation is low, right"
CL207,"If it's at 0%, right"
CL207,"So it's like, yeah, that just means the market is not bullish at all"
CL207,"And then if you also look deeper into what the positioning actually is, usually these are also because people are trying to short against the move, which causes"
CL207,"So essentially, these shorts would balance out the longs"
CL207,"So there is net, no leverage, which is why the interest rate stays at zero"
CL207,"So usually, that's been, or at least in 2018, when the futures started getting more popular on BitMEX, it was still, I don't know if every backwardation market, a local bottom at least"
CL207,"Now that futures are way more liquid and the majority of the volume, it has been marking bottoms, I would say, pretty reliably"
CL207,"And it's almost mathematically hard for it to not be a bottom, too, because it essentially just means that there's a lot of shorts"
CL207,And the smarter participants usually just start stepping in whenever that happens
CL207,"so oh, I have to explain"
CL207,"Yeah, so backwardation is just the future"
CL207,data contracts for Bitcoin is trading below the current spot price
CL207,"Essentially, that's a contract where you can buy on leverage"
CL207,"It's paying you to buy it, which is usually very rare for it to happen"
CL207,"Content goes the opposite, where people are paying an interest to use leverage, which is how it should be"
CL207,Because you're basically borrowing money
Host,would you identify a time where for example instead of being a bottom signal or near bottom signal or some sort of bullish continuation signal that instead it just falls through because normally by those dislocations recently have been very like quick like the future the future doesn't stay less especially like the dunes don't stay backwardated for long right especially if it's like a liquidation type of move usually it's recently at least on the big crash it snapped back pretty quickly so is the bearish case as simple as
Host,"those futures become backwardated and just kind of stay there as the market continues to float lower, like no one buys that up"
Host,Is it as simple as that or are there other things you look for when it comes to the future outlook
CL207,"Wait, sorry, you cut out first there"
Host,"Oh, my bad"
Host,"I'm saying, like, backwardation has been a good bottom slash bull signal, right"
Host,"What would it look like when it isn't, right"
Host,When it's no longer bullish
Host,Is it as simple as it just stays backwardated and that's it
Host,It doesn't get bought up and snapped back up
Host,Is it that simple
CL207,"I think staying backward is pretty good, usually"
CL207,"Yeah, I don't think there's been many cases where it's sustained backward, and then you see significant drawdowns"
CL207,"But yeah, I do remember clearly, just on the May 19 drop recently, at first, Ether went to 2,300, 2,400, and that already pushed June futures to negative"
CL207,"But I don't know why it didn't buy it, but yeah"
CL207,"But then, I think 20 minutes later, it went to 1,800"
CL207,"And I was like, holy shit, people are really getting absolutely destroyed"
CL207,"I guess it's hard to pinpoint, OK, this is where the liquidation cascade stops"
CL207,"So if the market has been long, net long, for a long period of time"
CL207,you can expect a while for all these long contracts to capitulate out of the market
CL207,"So yeah, usually the longer it stays leveraged for, the more severe that kind of drop happens"
CL207,So you maybe can just wait and set it out instead of trying to catch these temporarily
CL207,"that last for like a couple minutes or something, so"
CL207,"Yeah, I mean, I mean the"
CL207,"It's pretty hard sometimes in the futures markets, right"
CL207,"Liquidity wise, because I mean, I remember, it's gotten better, but I remember back in the day, I don't even know on which kind of like move it was, but I was trading on the futures and then I was trying to exit my position and I just couldn't"
CL207,"And I mean, I think like super, super short moves"
CL207,"Back then, it wasn't as liquid as it is now"
CL207,"These short, quick movements below are oftentimes people that just want to get out, but just can't find the liquidity to do so"
CL207,It just closes and it goes quickly below and then other people that are
CL207,"that are not under pressure, because I mean, let's be real, right"
CL207,Let's say you long the future and it starts going against you
CL207,"I mean, that's, for me at least, much more terrifying because you know that it can go backwards, right"
CL207,"And then you're like, okay, shit, my risk is here"
CL207,Where the fuck is this gonna go
CL207,"And then, yeah"
CL207,I've been trapped like that before and it's not fun
CL207,So I think like
CL207,"With these kind of sharp moves, like the small ones, can often be just one person or a couple people not having enough liquidity, basically"
CL207,And then the bigger ones are just really good buy opportunities because it's going to go to
CL207,"market price eventually, right"
CL207,"So you're just getting paid to buy something, which we're all bullish on anyway"
CL207,"So I mean, I can agree with you there"
CL207,"Like if you think if you just be backwards for a long time or like for like big for a bigger size, whatever, I mean, that's just pretty much free real estate right there"
CL207,You just get that
CL207,"In my opinion, anyway"
Host,What about the other side of the curve
Host,What about when premium are really high
Host,"I think we traded as high as, I think it was, was there a 70k handle traded in the next contract in front"
Host,"I don't have the exact numbers, but even at the same time, funding rates were super high and the premium was super high"
Host,"What do you look for on that side of things to kind of tell you, okay, maybe it's time to"
Host,Derisk or rotate or or do something because the backwardation signals like relatively rare
Host,and it's quite good What about on the other side of the curve
CL207,Usually historically at least like 20% been pretty good easy sells but like that was in the fair market like like okay
CL207,like it like
CL207,like we have prices been in a range for like years and
CL207,and then it pumps 20% and then like you see futures like 25% and that's like like annualized that's like okay people just start selling but this bull run has like slightly exceeded some of my expectations I think like we were at like 50% plus and like that's very like and these are like multi-months like very liquid interest rate markets so it's like
CL207,"Yeah, that's like billions of dollars on futures making locked in yields of like 50% annualized or more"
CL207,So it's been pretty crazy
CL207,"And because of that, it's been pretty hard to use it as a signal to pinpoint tops because"
