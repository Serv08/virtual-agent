CL207,Put the needle on the record
Jamo,Welcome to wage cucking with Jamo
Andreas,All right guys
Andreas,"Um, welcome to yet another episode of wage cucking with Jamo"
Andreas,"Uh, today we have a cat, it appears that has joined us for the podcast, better known as CL"
Andreas,"CL, how you doing"
CL207,"Uh, doing very well"
CL207,"Yeah, I think I'm just generally pretty happy, happy cat"
CL207,"So yeah, always, always positive"
Andreas,"But before we get started, let me know maybe a little bit background of how you got into crypto and also like where the whole cat meme originated from"
Andreas,I'm curious about that
CL207,So I got in 2018
CL207,"Actually, it was kind of a because I was horny"
CL207,"There's this good this girl in my college was like, yo, pull up to the blockchain club"
CL207,"I was like, no, no fucking clue what the fuck that is"
CL207,"But you know, her, her thighs were crazy"
CL207,I just followed her to the blockchain club
CL207,She's like talking about stuff I have no idea about
CL207,She told me XRP was a scam
CL207,That's all she said
CL207,"So I was like, sure, you know, I'll give you all my cash"
CL207,Buy me some crypto
CL207,So I bought like two grand of Bitcoin
CL207,"Then in a month, it dropped from like six grand to like three grand"
CL207,"And I was like, incredible"
CL207,"Like I don't know why, but like I just kept buying"
CL207,So that's how I got in
CL207,"And then I realized that, you know, just holding Bitcoin is like"
CL207,"makes me poor, because I went to 13K, I only went from five grand net worth to, I don't know, 15 grand net worth"
CL207,"And I was like, yeah, this is not working out"
CL207,I need to start using a ton of leverage
CL207,So that kept going
CL207,So that was how it started
CL207,"The catalog is multi-layered, multi-dimensioned, much deeper"
CL207,"So when I was one, my mom took me to a fortune teller"
CL207,And the fortune teller was like
CL207,"Wow, he's going to be a great writer, which is very true"
CL207,My tweets are always bangers and hitting
CL207,"But he said something else, which is really worrisome for our bloodline"
CL207,"He's gonna be like doing all right, like pretty good, but there's like a massive issue, like there is evil behind him, like trying to get him"
CL207,"But there's a counter attack, like you can prevent this, right"
CL207,"And she's like, yo, of course I wanna prevent it"
CL207,"And he's like, he needs like a very cute nickname, then he will do really well"
CL207,"And then she was like, huh, all right"
CL207,So she started calling me cat in Chinese
Andreas,This is when you're one years old
CL207,So that's how it started
CL207,"So, um, and then like, you know, many, many, uh, years later, uh, and this is like, these two events are not even like related"
CL207,"Um, I didn't even know like, or I, like in my head, I didn't even know this background story, um, nor was aware like why she was calling me a cat, whatever bullshit"
CL207,"Um, and then"
CL207,"One day, a bunch of my friends were like, you know, this, this is like totally you"
CL207,"Like you should just beat, like beat this"
CL207,And it was like some cat profile picture
CL207,"And I was like, yeah"
CL207,I'm down there
CL207,"You know, why not"
CL207,So I became a cat
CL207,"And then, um, over time, like, you know, COVID happened"
CL207,"I had to put on the hazmat suit, you know, virtually, you know, virtual COVID could hit you hard"
CL207,So I got this hazmat suit
CL207,"I chose yellow and then, um, you know"
CL207,"And then one day I was like, wait, hold up"
CL207,"Like, why my, that same identity as like, well, my mom's calling me"
CL207,I had this like insane realization like maybe two years later
CL207,So I asked her and then she told me the fortune teller story
CL207,"I was like very mind blown that it like, it all bridged together"
CL207,"So I think that's a, that's a full door of the, yeah, the cat persona"
Andreas,Are we going to see like an evolution of the maybe get rid of the hazmat suit and add something else now that COVID is over or not really a thing anymore
CL207,"No, I think it's very unique, like easy to recognizable"
CL207,Yellow is like adorable color
CL207,I think it's very good
CL207,"So like at this point, I don't think I'll change it"
CL207,"And it's like, if you want to like"
CL207,take off my like hazmat suit
Andreas,"Uh, maybe if you're a hot girl potentially, but"
Andreas,"yeah, otherwise, it's like the hat stays on the, the suit stays on the suit"
Andreas,"So it sounds like you started with like, uh, you started with like a few thousand dollars, um, when you got into crypto and it seems like you, you ran it up"
Andreas,"Um, I'd say mostly trading, right"
CL207,"I was, um, yeah, pretty much"
CL207,"Yeah, I think not near 99% of my gains is like Bitcoin ETH just trading"
Andreas,"Do you have like a way you characterize your trading style or just like your, your general outlook when you approach trading"
CL207,"I mean, this is hard to explain, but like"
CL207,"Like there's always levels which I, well, at least to me, it's like relatively obvious"
CL207,"I watch people take positions and I'm like, and then you automatically in your head generate a mental liquidation profile of all these trades, right"
CL207,So it's like very simple
CL207,"Like if they're on the X20, it's 5% move, you know, it's X25, 4%"
CL207,X10 is very popular
CL207,So like 10% moves usually never happens
CL207,It always runs like few percent deeper just like from these liquidations
CL207,Or just generally stop losses being triggered at a pretty obvious level
CL207,"And then at least when I used to trade, I try to shove it a little bit more into that way so they get fucked a little bit harder"
CL207,"and then I sell into when they're getting fucked and then, yeah"
Andreas,"Yeah, I've always had an issue describing, so I used to trade quite a bit back in the day"
Andreas,I was pretty much weekly or monthly or whatever it was on the BitMEX leaderboard when BitMEX was a thing
Andreas,And then people would ask me what your trading style was
Andreas,It's hard to describe
Andreas,It's mostly just
Andreas,being in there and then trading and a lot of like trial and error
Andreas,"And then you like looking at certain things and like having a feel and figuring out like, you've seen this before and you've seen the situation before and you sort of know like the, the eventual outcome"
Andreas,"Um, but also, um, I think you mentioned that recently that like you, you don't trade nearly as much anymore"
Andreas,Is there a reason why
CL207,"Uh, a bit of everything"
CL207,I think I
CL207,For a while I really really loved knowing where price was going
CL207,It was like this strong curiosity and like urge to
CL207,"just want to be correct, just want to know why each moves are happening, and then predicting it, and then put a bit of money on all my views"
CL207,"And then over time, I'm not sure why, it just doesn't hit the same"
CL207,"And on top of that, there's one day, I think almost the very last day of December 2020"
CL207,"yeah, last day of the year"
CL207,"I was just like, you know"
CL207,"I had like an AVI bag, not too much"
CL207,I had an SNX bag
CL207,"There weren't like millions of dollars, but like, I just felt like the swing was so crazy"
CL207,I just kept going up
CL207,"I'm like, why am I still holding this shit"
CL207,"Like, or like, like all my trades are working and hitting like, I'm just going to take a break for a bit"
CL207,"And then once I took that break, I"
CL207,It was so mind blowing how I didn't realize how stressed I was
CL207,"I didn't realize it was like, you know, clouds above my head"
CL207,"Because I do it 24 seven, you know, when I sleep, I dream about it"
CL207,I had an ex I like when I fuck I'm actually thinking about the chart
CL207,um like there's there's like there's no nothing else in the universe other than like me like trying to outplay someone on like btc usd perps so it was like
CL207,just i like i don't know i just couldn't like redo that ever again just because like
CL207,yeah once once that stress and everything like lifted um i was just like
CL207,you know i was just happy to live like this um nothing's wrong
CL207,yes this is great um this is what
CL207,i guess originally fought for and
CL207,"I'm just going to, yeah, not go as hard"
Andreas,"Do you think it's more difficult to show profit as a professional trader now than it was say like in 2018 when you got in or like, like around 2020 bull market, like around those times"
CL207,That's also hard
CL207,I think it's around this
CL207,It's not too much harder
CL207,I think it's still very doable
CL207,"I don't really trade too much anymore, but I can still"
CL207,"like take a quick look and like, like sometimes I have a very strong bias and my hit rate at least mentally so far, like I've mental trades I'm taking and they're hitting pretty well"
CL207,"Um, so I don't know, I've ascended to a level"
CL207,"I'm just like, yeah"
CL207,I'm mentally taking profit here
CL207,"Like, Oh, that was a great trade"
CL207,"Like, yeah, yeah"
CL207,I still got this totally
Andreas,"It's like, it's like self validation, right"
CL207,"Like, if I made this trade, I would have been right"
CL207,"So yeah, just stuff like that"
CL207,So I definitely think yeah
CL207,"it's like the ETF coming in, it's not like completely a meme, at least in the moment, right"
CL207,"It's like, the flows are so strong, you can like just trend follow"
CL207,"I don't know, there's so much bullshit you can do still"
CL207,"A lot of it still trades similarly to 2019, 2020"
CL207,Maybe there's less percentages
CL207,"We hit a bunch of traders' margin levels, and then maybe we do 3% instead of 20%"
CL207,We used to bar it nonstop
CL207,It definitely matured in that sense
CL207,3% still so huge
Andreas,At least you can still show quite a bit of profit doing that
Andreas,"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Andreas,Were there any like on your way up
Andreas,Were there any like Super Bowl memorable trades or positions you took that were that they don't have to be like huge or anything but that like you have like super high conviction on or you were pretty proud of in retrospect
CL207,"Yeah, I'm extremely proud of the July, August move in summer 2020, because I think I'm the only one on Twitter who's calling like, we're going to send so hard that Binance is going to break"
CL207,And it literally broke
CL207,It was the biggest candle
CL207,"I tweeted out, it was like, I give it like one third chance"
CL207,We're going to print the biggest move in Bitcoin history
CL207,And I think it was a move from like 28 to like 40K on Binance futures
CL207,um in like two minutes or something something crazy like that um so i'm very validated by that like just um just that that just means like i was correct about the market's positioning and
CL207,then like where the recreation levels were and like people just getting cascaded into like empty books so many of them in fact that blindness goes down like like these being correct like
CL207,and then i also said how like market will never short the short like bitcoin this hard ever again which we haven't seen so far
CL207,"So like that's like one thing I'm pretty proud of, I guess, but not really too many memorable trades"
CL207,I actually fucked up that trade super hard just because I was holding the position for a month and it was just ranging and doing nothing
CL207,"Um, but I still managed to catch a decent move"
CL207,"So yeah, if you're up here, I'm happy"
CL207,"So yeah, like, yeah"
Andreas,"Yeah, that makes sense"
Andreas,I sort of have the similar feelings about trading
Andreas,"I feel like I'm way less hungry, I guess now, in order to validate myself since I'd been in the space for so long and had reasonable success"
Andreas,"A lot of the times where I have bigger positions, I leave them open when going to sleep"
Andreas,But I'm not like you
Andreas,and I don't think about the the charts for having sex or anything
Andreas,But I don't anymore
Andreas,But I also don't have sex anymore
Andreas,"Yeah, like I would there would like be some nights where like I go to bed at midnight and like wake up like automatically wake up at like two or three am and log on to my computer and and check my position and stuff like that"
Andreas,Like I guess trading with size can be stressful at times even if like I feel like I have like reasonable like tolerance for the swings like I can I can remain non emotional
Andreas,"it when like making a lot of money and also losing a lot of money, it doesn't affect me emotionally either way"
Andreas,"But like, I've had like a pretty long history of, you know, like gambling, playing poker, stuff like that, where it's sort of ingrained into me"
Andreas,"But like, I see that trait in like, a lot of New York traders where they like, have like, positions with conviction or something like that, and then it goes wrong, or like, something happens, and then they get they get like, emotional and like"
Andreas,"you know, that they can't really think logically"
Andreas,"and they either add to the position or that they do something that they normally wouldn't do if they were like, you know, in their A game or in a state of mind where they're trading at like the best of their abilities"
Andreas,"So do you see any like, how do you describe like the best traders or the most optimal traders"
Andreas,Like what traits do they have that make them the best
CL207,"Yeah, basically what you said is I think amazing, like just absolutely ascended mentally, like nothing is gonna like you're never tilted, obviously, you're not going to revenge trade, obviously, like, at least that that to me is like very barbaric behavior, like if you can't like even mentally control your like your like discipline, like your mental state, if you can't control these, um"
CL207,I think that's pretty barbaric
CL207,"I don't know if that's insulting, but that's just how I view it"
CL207,"I don't think I've ever had too much problem with discipline, but that's definitely improved a lot as I traded over time"
CL207,"Yeah, I think mental is definitely the most important"
CL207,"Because if you can think clearly, then you're going to have good risk management"
CL207,"You're going to think how much you're going to put on where you're going to cut, where you're going to just eat the loss"
CL207,Just stuff like that
CL207,"Um, and just accepting your wrong is so critical too"
CL207,"Um, yeah, for sure"
CL207,"I respect people who can accept their wrong so much, just because I feel like the average dude in finance is like, always like the big Dick, like, I don't know, like Ferrari, like it's always like, you know, uh, very high T, um, not saying that it's low T, but I think it's more mentally ascended if you can like accept where you're wrong"
CL207,"So it's just like, yeah"
Andreas,"Yeah, I think I think that's very important like figuring out where you're wrong and like, more importantly, why what you did was wrong or why your thesis was incorrect or what would happen that like invalidated what you were doing, and then learning from that experience rather than, you know"
Andreas,"Like, you know, the meme where the guy's pointing the mirror like the market is wrong"
Andreas,I'm not wrong
Andreas,"Like I feel like I know it's a meme, but it describes like a lot of people in crypto, right"
Andreas,"Like they have like conviction over certain things and then like a lot of it becomes invalidated or like circumstances change and they're just like unwilling to accept their wrong and, you know, increase their conviction or just sort of stubborn about it"
Andreas,"And I think that's like a pretty big downfall of like a lot of people trading crypto is that they aren't like, willing to accept that like, you lose quite a bit and like, you know, like, when you lose, you either, you either like blame the market or blame others, or you just figure out like what went wrong and how you can adjust in the future to, you know, lose less"
Jamo,"Do you guys, both of you, do you always have a plan"
Jamo,"Like if this level breaks, if this news event happens or if the reaction isn't what I expected either on social media or on the chart"
Jamo,Do you plan that out
Jamo,Do you write it down or do you just like
Jamo,"Uh, or, or go full eyes at George Soros who just wakes up and is like, my back hurts"
Jamo,"I'm going to close this, uh, position for, for, for me specifically"
Andreas,"Um, I feel like I'm one to not really like, uh, I do have a plan like going in, but like the plan changes if like information changes"
Andreas,And then I think that's important
Andreas,"And then also, I'm one not to be tied to any of my positions"
Andreas,"If I think stuff is going wrong, I'll get out as soon as possible"
Andreas,"I'll eat the loss, and I won't really think twice about it"
Andreas,"Other than that, I think roughly going in, you have some sort of plan, some sort of levels that you're looking at"
Andreas,"I think crypto especially is one of those markets where, you know, there's just like so many factors that go in and you can't like, you can't go in like with an exact plan of, you know, like, my thesis is invalidated if like the price hits this level, but then like in a day, like"
Andreas,the whole landscape could be completely different
Andreas,"Like there could be new news or like new people like within the trade or like open interest goes up, stuff like that, that you sort of need to adjust your expectations in real time"
CL207,"As for like levels breaking and like reactions, I guess I do have some of these"
CL207,"Like let's say if I see the market is like super shorted, but like if we take a high and like"
CL207,It's like a very weak
CL207,like very few amounts of shorts coming out
CL207,"I might have to doubt my assumptions, stuff like that"
CL207,"But generally I also don't do any news at all just because, you know, I'm clicking on the like literal retail interface on like Binance or some share"
CL207,"I'm not gonna like, I'll compete these all goes or whatever, like popping off in like 200 millisecond, whatever, whatever, right"
CL207,"I don't ever, so I don't do any like information stuff"
CL207,"Yeah, there's been a few times where I'm just like literally trading and then CPI comes in"
CL207,"and I'm like, what the, I didn't know, which is like absolutely like retarded of me, I guess, but that happened a few times"
CL207,"And otherwise, yeah, I just do my thing"
CL207,"I guess just like low information, more, just more chart and more, uh, like, like, I don't know the momentum trend, like right"
CL207,"Definitely, I don't take notes either, I guess"
CL207,You can do whatever you want
CL207,Everyone's a bit different
CL207,I don't think there's one way to win
CL207,It's probably any other money-making thing
CL207,There's definitely a lot of ways
CL207,"Everyone's different, yeah"
Andreas,"Yeah, that definitely makes sense"
Andreas,"Yeah, I wanted to move on and talk a bit about some other topics for first one I have written down is friend tech"
Andreas,"I remember like this is a while ago, but you and I had differing views on the the outlook of friend tech you were like pretty bullish at the time"
Andreas,and I thought it was I was I wouldn't say I was bearish
Andreas,but like I didn't really see the upside especially like if
Andreas,"Like to me, when I look at projects in crypto, like I look at like the proprietary aspect and then like the community aspect"
Andreas,"And it just seemed like at the time, like first there wasn't like much proprietary, like it didn't seem like a platform that that couldn't have been cloned like very easily"
Andreas,"And then like, if you look at the activity"
Andreas,All on it
Andreas,"It seemed like it was almost like a like an echo chamber of people just like, you know, buying each other's keys, communicating with each other and stuff like that with like a few like big thought leaders"
Andreas,And then it I feel like these things and crypto like I've seen in the past where
Andreas,"You know, like you have this promise payoff of like you like the points or the whatever you're getting paid off and then you have sort of like the thought leaders like profiting on the followers and then the whole thing falls apart"
Andreas,"So at the time, what was your like, what was your thesis or what was your outlook on Frentech and has it changed today"
CL207,"Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious it's changed"
CL207,"a while ago, but I think initially I think I was much more excited about signaling via key purchases and sales"
CL207,Although I was never treated anything like
CL207,so I fantasize about a lot of things I think and
CL207,I think I wished it was something like
CL207,"Okay, we tell each other who we like and don't like via buying and selling keys"
CL207,and how that could signal to like people who aren't as in the strict
CL207,and I don't know that this entire like CT cabal like who's a better actor who's like a not as good of an actor
CL207,Although the main problem with friend tech was it actually had no true negative signaling
CL207,"And negative signaling had to be done in an anonymous way in my opinion, just because otherwise it's just extremely like aggressive, right"
CL207,And I don't think people are like open enough to do that
CL207,"I think generally that kind of stuff people tend to be a bit shy even if like, I don't know"
CL207,"you're like an MMA fighter, you're not going to go online and be like, I hate this guy, literally like click this button"
CL207,"So I think that was one issue I didn't realize very early on, which was like lack of negative signaling and how there was only positive signaling"
CL207,And then that kind of turned into more of a Ponzi real quick
CL207,"Um, I guess after like two, three months, I realized like, okay, this, this is actually not as cool as I thought"
CL207,"Or like, I was just like, um, like I was fantasized"
CL207,"I was like, like having this fantasy of the, the same being something else, which is like totally not, um, right"
CL207,"So I, yeah"
CL207,"I think I, I didn't like mention about like price or like"
CL207,Like the airdrop going into like the token event then didn't tell anyone to buy it
CL207,I just like averaged out real quick and like one day People are like you're retarded
CL207,"And I'm like, okay, whatever"
CL207,there's not much you can do so besides like the the negative signaling is there anything else like in retrospect that you would like change about the platform to make it more on a
Andreas,more useful or have a better outlook in your eyes
CL207,I mean like just claiming the airdrop was like every the entire community was like having aids from like trying to even like get it to work so I think that's pretty bad because like UI is like very critically important because like I think not maybe not enough people or brands or just like projects think about this but like
CL207,Your experience with something is very critical
CL207,"So if you have a negative experience or that's a negative emotion about this thing, then you are literally more likely to not want the thing, which is the token, whatever it has to do with it"
CL207,"But if you have positive emotions about something, you're more likely to buy the thing"
CL207,It's like how marketing 101 is
CL207,So it's like the fact that the app lacks so hard
CL207,"was definitely a problem, I think, in my opinion"
CL207,"And then although they try to fix it, it was always kind of a thing, right"
CL207,Especially when we all try to use it
CL207,And I think otherwise it's a completely okay platform
CL207,I don't think he ever meant it for it to be reputational
CL207,And I think I just fantasized about it being that because
CL207,"us buying and selling keys were a public display of liking, right"
CL207,But I think Racer really wanted it to be kind of like a fan community thing
CL207,"Like, oh, you think Hasaka's a go, you think I'm the go, you think Ko... Not me, sorry"
CL207,provided any value
CL207,"Like if you thought Kobe was a go, you know, you buy like two of their keys and then ask them some nice questions, they will reply"
CL207,So that's like real value
CL207,"And there's definitely a market for that, but like definitely not like whatever billion, five billion, 10 billion, I was like mentally jacking off about, right"
Andreas,"Yeah, it makes sense"
Andreas,"I think I think the real bull case is what you described, because the whole social aspect of crypto is, you know, it's there every day like crypto Twitter is just like nonstop 24 seven"
Andreas,"But then like it's difficult to filter, you know, the actual people who you should be following versus the ones that like have real following"
Andreas,"So the key system of like, you see people you respect and what keys they own, it's sort of like a signal that gives validation to people, especially like the smaller accounts, because I think in crypto Twitter, there are quite a few smaller accounts that aren't as well known, but are extremely sharp and put out extremely good content"
Andreas,"And then there's just like tons and tons of accounts that have like hundreds of thousands of followers, millions of followers that are just like"
Andreas,"complete garbage, either paid shills or just spewing nonsense or very low level information"
Andreas,But if you don't really know what you're looking for or what you're looking at or how to interpret information
Andreas,Like especially if you're new to crypto like this is like your first or second cycle
Andreas,It's sort of difficult to to read through the content on crypto Twitter and determine like who's bullshit and who's not full of shit unless you and friend tech sort of has a system
Andreas,"Like if I'm trusted or people know that I'm like a sharp trader or I'm good at like, you know, certain things within the space and I'm buying keys of these people that are like less known, it gives validation to them and then they buy keys of other people and then it's just sort of like an inherent trust and validation system that makes a lot more sense than just like the net followers and that following on Twitter"
Jamo,On Frontek with the pricing it had
Jamo,"It seemed to me like that made it a bit difficult because if I'm Jamo's fan, so I buy the key, I'm one of the first key holders, and I ask him questions, he answers"
Jamo,That's working for me
Jamo,"But for fan number 1000, has to buy the 1000 key"
Jamo,"It becomes so expensive that there's, don't you get this natural cap on your audience"
CL207,"but I guess if you have a thousand fans, that's"
CL207,"he is that expensive, kind of, I guess"
CL207,"It's hard to justify all of this, I guess, but I think the model was mostly okay, at least I thought so, especially if you are not in a for-profit, right"
CL207,"Because once you buy the, I don't know, there was some certain level of price, it takes exponentially more buying for you to even be able to get outbreak even"
CL207,I think that that part was good in that it prevented speculation or like way too much of that
CL207,"But it was also obviously very like extractive on because people did try to like, you know fuck around They found out really hard way like, you know, all the fees were just like"
CL207,Did you guys sell your own keys did you dump on your on your fence
CL207,"No, I still have like"
CL207,"I don't know, 50 F or like 30, at least, yeah, probably around 50-ish F in the thing"
CL207,"Yeah, I did try to play it"
CL207,"I bought a bunch of smaller accounts and I bought multiple keys, stuff like that for the smaller accounts"
CL207,"I actually self-sniped seven keys, 70 keys because, yeah, because people were gonna snipe it and then like"
CL207,"Yeah, I didn't sell that because that just like looks really bad"
CL207,And so you don't need a couple of E's
CL207,"So it's like, it's okay to just like put it there"
Andreas,"Well, one thing I really like about the front end system is that everything is pretty transparent"
Andreas,"So I mean, you can see like who's like, for example, I know there are a bunch of people that had a large following that promised to share, you know, like the airdrop with their, with their key holders and then see like, which one of them is actually shared, which one of them are just like dumping, which one of them are doing what"
Andreas,"Because normally on Twitter, if you have a large account showing a low cap cryptocurrency, you don't know their entry, if they're dumping on you, when they're accumulating, stuff like that"
Andreas,"But specifically with these friend tech accounts, everything is pretty transparent"
Andreas,"So you can see who's telling the truth, who's lying, who's full of shit, and stuff like that"
CL207,"Uh, there was definitely, uh, a couple, uh, notable accounts that promise to share that airdrop and, uh"
CL207,I will not go further on this topic
Jamo,"You can, you can check it"
Jamo,"You can check it on the Explorer, right"
CL207,"Check, check the chain"
CL207,"I don't know, man"
Andreas,Let's move on a bit
Andreas,"Um, the next thing I had on the list was, uh"
Andreas,"I want to talk a little bit of blast because I believe you're an investor there and I feel like this is a more broad discussion, not necessarily pretending to blast, but about like the"
Andreas,either like layer to our protocol points meta in general um so like for the listeners or watchers who don't know blast was in ethereum l2 which had like a pretty prominent points program like even before the the trend existed like i want to say like two to three billion dollars were locked in the multi-sig with promising points and then only recently
Andreas,"I think within the last few weeks, the blast token was released"
Andreas,Do you have any thoughts on this current meta
Andreas,"in lieu of yield farming or like specifically allocating like certain percentages you're getting from yield through like fees or through a native token, you're just like given these speculative points and then like you're sort of speculating on their value at the end of the point cycle"
Andreas,Do you think this is like a good thing and if it will continue in the future
CL207,"Yeah, I think"
CL207,"Actually, before we talk about this, can we also talk about life"
CL207,"Because I actually want to know you better, because I don't know anything about you actually"
CL207,"We can go after this, but yeah, for point systems, I guess, I mean, they obviously work, right"
CL207,"Like it's, it's not like a Starbucks and every, like, I don't know if like chase, like any airline are doing points because it doesn't work"
CL207,Like it clearly works
CL207,And it's like
CL207,"Yeah, it just works"
CL207,It's very simple
CL207,We all like want to get points for whatever reason
CL207,"It's like crazy, but that's how our brain works"
CL207,And I guess
CL207,"yeah, Tation was pretty early on to that, like the blur, right"
CL207,"I've always thought of him as like one of the greatest, greatest like Ponzi builders in the space"
CL207,And on top of that
CL207,It tend to come to something like slightly new
CL207,So it's like pretty good
CL207,"Um, and like, I just had to invest because he, like, you know, he, he literally stole open sea from open sea"
CL207,So it was like a no brainer at the time
CL207,"Cause there was, it wasn't much other deals"
Andreas,"Um, and you were, you were mainly investing in like the, the person rather than the, like the general idea you just believed in him"
CL207,A bit of both
CL207,"I thought, I mean, like, why not"
CL207,"Why not have all the funds there, like, earn some yield"
CL207,"It makes everyone more money, right"
CL207,"It's like, it goes, it's way more 3-3 than like every other"
CL207,"Parking your funds anywhere else, right"
CL207,So I thought it was like decent enough of a idea to go for
Andreas,"Yeah, that definitely makes sense"
Andreas,So what are the topics of life you wanted to talk about
Andreas,"I think outside of crypto, one of the interests I have is investing in real estate just because... I thought you were going to say cooking"
Andreas,But I think investing in real estate is really interesting to me because it's an asset that you can use as opposed to crypto
Andreas,You can never really use any of your
Andreas,"It's mostly just if I'm trading or something or if I'm holding spot and then the number goes up, I'm still staring at the same computer screen and the number is just bigger"
Andreas,But my life
Andreas,overall like doesn't really change
Andreas,And then it did to me
Andreas,it's just like a pretty reasonable hedge on everything just like in the doomsday you know like scenario where
Andreas,All crypto goes to zero or if I get like hacked
Andreas,"or you know, like I lose my private keys or you know, like if suddenly like Binance and like Bybit and wherever else I'm trading go and solve it"
Andreas,and I lose all those funds I still have something that like so some tangible assets
Andreas,"Other than that, I don't know"
Andreas,Stuff like that just interests me just because I feel like I have a much different view on money and assets than a lot of people
Andreas,Making more money doesn't necessarily make me want to go out and just ball out and be popping bottles at the club or spending all this money on whatever
Andreas,I always thought about the general utility of money and how I utilize my funds to be as useful as possible to what I want in life and what I'm looking for
Andreas,I think real estate is one of the
Andreas,the bigger things that I've become interested in
Andreas,"My thesis on real estate, especially high-end real estate, is that one of the limiting factors in the world is the availability of the underlying land or the locations that are high value"
Andreas,You can always build more
Andreas,"real estate and undeveloped areas, but like the there's just like certain like areas like, you know, like really nice beachfront property or like a really nice like mountain property and like, like the high end like ski areas and stuff like that, that are limited not by like a little limited by land itself, like, rather than like the costs and the development and anything like that"
Andreas,"like the general thesis is like, I valued that like a lot more"
Andreas,"And I also see these markets, I want to say not necessarily a recession proof, but they that they trade at like a different frequency than like the rest of the market"
Andreas,"So like, for example, if there's like a housing crisis, or if you know, like, there's some sort of like, global macro event, like the"
Andreas,The lower end real estate may may follow suit and like trade relative to that
Andreas,"But I feel like that there's always there's always going to be like, even if we go in like global recession or something like that, there's always going to be like"
Andreas,"elite wealthy people in the world and as an asset, these assets are always going to be limited based on availability so that they'll maintain their value through whatever happens in the future"
Andreas,I think that's generally my thesis when looking at this stuff
Andreas,"And a lot of the times, a lot of the stuff seems overvalued, but then you look at historical prices and they just go straight up and it's kind of crazy"
Andreas,"But the thing I equated to is like owning like a like a major sports team like like a European football team or like an American like basketball team, something like that, is that, like, the valuations have gone like I know you guys probably don't follow this, but the valuations has gone up to from like"
Andreas,"I want to say like a couple hundred million, like in the 2000s to like three, four or five billion"
Andreas,And it's not because like they're more valuable or because they're generating more money
Andreas,They are generating a little bit more money
Andreas,But the main thing is just like they almost represent like a status symbol for
Andreas,like elite wealthy people so that they're willing to pay like a huge huge premium anytime one of these teams goes on market
Andreas,Is it like owning some
Jamo,"I think it's like only some old extremely expensive piece of art, like some Picasso thing"
Andreas,"I think it's like a bit different than that because like, for example, like in the U.S"
Andreas,"teams like the New York Yankees or the Los Angeles Lakers, they have certain valuations, but they'll never sell for those valuations just because the owners will never sell basically"
Andreas,If you're like a
Andreas,"a multi-multi-billionaire, the value of having like 10 or 20 billion dollars more, like selling your team at a huge premium, isn't as valuable as, you know, just like, for example, owning the Los Angeles Lakers, so like when any celebrity or any, you know, any of your network is in LA, you can just take them and this is your team, you know, stuff like that"
Andreas,"That, like, intangible value"
Andreas,is I feel like quite a lot more valuable than the actual monetary aspect
Andreas,"Yeah, go ahead"
Jamo,"And then if you're going to impress your friends, right"
Jamo,Then that scales with how much money you have
Jamo,"So for somebody whose net worth is much higher, the value of being able to take somebody to your Yankee stadium is much, much more higher"
Jamo,So for somebody with a lower net worth to buy it becomes unreasonable
Andreas,Do you have any purchases you've made from your time in crypto where you started with a few thousand dollars and you ran it up to quite a bit
Andreas,"Or any aspirations for the end game, basically, if you have a really good year in trading or if you're doing really well, what you would do with the funds"
CL207,"That's such a hard question, but I don't think I've had too much gigatrillionaire dreams or what I'm going to do with it"
CL207,"Yeah, no clue"
CL207,"Honestly, I'm just going to do the same thing because it's pretty nice so far and I'm very content with my current"
CL207,"Although not extremely, definitely not hyper wealth at all"
CL207,"Yeah, pretty happy with that"
CL207,"I mean, like, you have to put it in my hands for me to like, start thinking about it"
Andreas,Do you ever get this thought that's like
Andreas,Your life doesn't necessarily change that much if you continue to do really well
Andreas,The marginal utility of the future money that you're going to make doesn't really change what you want to do in life or your day-to-day routine
Andreas,Those are some thoughts that
Andreas,I have quite a bit
Andreas,I think there's quite a bit of opportunity cost for just working all the time versus going out and doing whatever you want
Andreas,"Obviously, if I work all the time, I can make more money, I can have more success, I can be better at what I do"
Andreas,"If I'm at a point where I have the bankroll, I have the funds to live my life the way I want it, and even if I double or triple that, I'm still going to be just shitposting on Twitter or sitting around on my computer"
Andreas,It's not like I have aspirations to be shitposting on a private jet or something
Andreas,That doesn't really add value to what I'm doing
CL207,"Right, so I guess one thing would be like what I've seen of hyperwealth, you know, yeah, continue to live in hotels"
CL207,"But actually, I'm not sure"
CL207,"But like, I guess I want a private chef"
CL207,"So when I wake up, there's like food"
CL207,"I want like extremely, extremely, extremely healthy food, because I am like"
CL207,It's very into being healthy
CL207,I've not had a full glass of sugar beverage for nine years
CL207,I don't even eat birthday cakes at all
CL207,"Actually, I've made two exceptions this year or one exception here and there, but you can count them in one hand"
CL207,That's how little sugar I consume
CL207,"And like, I always have broccoli, like either broccoli or berries almost every day"
CL207,"That's just my vitamin C fiber, like antioxidant intake"
CL207,"You know, I just make extremely healthy"
CL207,"And then like after, and I always eat that first because when you eat that, like, and then you have like your favorite fruits, like say I'll have a pasta, it's a little bit of carbs, not too crazy"
CL207,"But then, but because you ate the fiber first, you actually digest that way slower"
CL207,And then like your glucose spike is like way softer
CL207,Just stuff like that
CL207,I hear a lot about my appearance
CL207,My skin is in amazing conditions
CL207,Every girl would be jealous
CL207,And then I guess I also have like a bunch of like
CL207,like somewhat philanthropic thoughts
CL207,"I know this word is like giga curse now because of saying bank man, but like there's like a bunch of like, yeah"
CL207,there's a bunch of like content creators
CL207,"Like I really, really like respect just because like you can clearly tell like, Oh, this guy or this girl, like they are completely not selling out"
CL207,"They are, they're like, say producing content purely like the amount of passion they have for say a video game where like"
CL207,whatever they're doing is like so great that that they just do that and that they have no view about like like no sense about like be doing business or like like how this doing this or that can make me more money so like if I can like support more of these people like it makes me really fulfilled I guess
CL207,yeah um just because like I guess I do follow a bunch of these people and like they I just think they're very cool um I'm very big into like
CL207,"expression, virtual expression, or just like expression in real life, I dress well"
CL207,"But yeah, just like stuff like that, I really respect like people who do that online too"
CL207,"so yeah, stuff like that"
CL207,"If I can support more people, that's like very awesome"
CL207,"But yeah, I think living in hotels is like an amazing door and like me"
CL207,"As I said, I'm someone who lives in a fantasy"
CL207,I just want to do this forever
CL207,"I want to stay young forever, which is why I have all these routines"
CL207,"Although I've done a few lines of Coke before, I don't think that's really bad for your aging"
CL207,A few lines before
CL207,It's all delta neutral
CL207,I had a lot of broccoli hours before
CL207,take other stuff for preventing higher blood pressure if I do stuff like this
CL207,"Yeah, definitely hedged"
CL207,I do care a lot about this kind of stuff
CL207,But I also value a lot about having fun with my friends
CL207,Emotions is another thing
CL207,"I'm a big maxi-elf, yeah"
CL207,"Sorry, you go"
Jamo,"Oh no, I was going to ask you, if you're going to have steak and broccoli, do you eat the broccoli first also"
CL207,"Yeah, I literally eat the entire plate of broccoli"
CL207,Like it's like a massive plate
CL207,I will literally finish it before starting the steak
CL207,"It's like, it's pretty easy to me because I guess I made it a habit and just like, you know, I'm a trader"
CL207,I have the discipline to do that
Jamo,"I'm going to, I'm going to try this tonight"
Andreas,"Are there any like, um, health influencers that you respect or that you follow"
CL207,"Oh, I, okay, this might be like disrespectful, but I do not respect any other trader"
CL207,I do not respect any like whatever influence
CL207,"So just cause like, I'm going to just like absorb the information and like a lot of readings"
CL207,"I love doing readings and then just like, or trading"
CL207,"Like I always have my own view, my own system"
CL207,"Um, whenever I listen to others, like it worsens my, it actually makes it worse for me"
CL207,So just like
CL207,"Like I know if you eat five weeks before a real meal, you will have like"
CL207,a slower glucose spike
CL207,"This is like proven countless times, right"
CL207,"Like just stuff like that is like, basically are facts, uh, proven nonstop"
CL207,Like I will do them
CL207,"Um, so I don't have a lot of influence"
Andreas,"So, so like the stuff you're looking at is like more on the lines of like peer reviewed studies and stuff like that, rather than like, you know, other people telling you what's good and what's not good"
CL207,"Yeah, the scientific term of like these, uh, like the, the impact of a meal is called like postprandial spike"
CL207,"You know, the first time we read it, like Google, like 18 words out of 30 words in the first paragraph"
CL207,"But you know, it's honestly not that crazy"
CL207,"You open a paper, yeah, first minute you have to Google half the shit, but then you understand everything and then you keep going, right"
CL207,"It's like, it's honestly not as scary as people think"
Andreas,"I used to like years and years ago, I was like a biochemistry major and I worked for a few years at like a pharmaceutical company, like doing research"
Andreas,So I read through like quite a few of those like back in the day and a lot of them were like very
Andreas,"tedious to get through, to say the least"
Andreas,"But it's sort of like, I feel like that art of, you know, reading through the research yourself rather than just like, I mean, kids these days, I feel like they get their scientific information from like TikTok or like, you know, their source of information is within these like"
Andreas,"10 to 15 second clips of like other people telling them what's correct and what's incorrect without like any like reasonable like validation or, you know, like with peer reviews, stuff like that"
Andreas,"And I don't know, maybe it's such me"
Andreas,but maybe it's like a sign of
Andreas,declining society and where we're going
Andreas,Do you have any thoughts on that
Andreas,I feel like it's not great
CL207,I absolutely have thoughts on it
CL207,"My biggest two beliefs about education is one, we need to teach about online fraud because"
CL207,The economy is already going so virtual
CL207,We have Amazon now
CL207,We didn't have it 15 years ago
CL207,We have eBay
CL207,All these things are popping off
CL207,So much skin trading and obviously crypto
CL207,"And then people are getting all these emails that are like, oh, you're a student"
CL207,"And then I don't know, some school should get hacked so easily"
CL207,And then you get a fraudulent mail about your school deposit
Andreas,they need to learn that
Andreas,and then another thing is the scammers the scammers are getting like really sophisticated these days like a lot of the scams i see that you know are executed
Andreas,they're they're well thought out like very well planned to like even for me looking at them like saying like wow this is like pretty impressive what they're doing
CL207,"Yeah, you already got rubbed on FTX and then a fake claims email come out, you got rubbed again"
CL207,"And it's just not crypto, exactly"
CL207,"It's like so much everywhere, right"
CL207,And then another big belief I have is everyone needs to learn about research methods
CL207,"So this course in college teaches you how to research information for yourself, right"
CL207,But it's just like this general idea of trying to obtain correct
CL207,like information for yourself is just so important like
CL207,yeah i feel like many people don't really get to learn that or
CL207,like yeah they just don't right so it's like these two topics are like very critical in modern day that i think like no school teaches about it
CL207,it's just like or it's not like a critical course
CL207,but like it's like it has to be like a foundational course in my opinion yeah
Andreas,"Well, one other thing I'd add to that is I think just like general financial literacy is not taught in schools"
Andreas,"And like, I feel like that's absolutely ridiculous, just being able to, you know, like manage your money, which is like, might be the most important thing you learn when you're younger"
Andreas,"I mean, like in schools these days, they're cheating stuff about like"
Andreas,world history and like geology
Andreas,and you know just like stuff that you really don't need to know in life even like a lot of like the mathematics that you learn in um in like let's say like middle school or or like advanced high school like i can't think of like the the last time i really use you know stuff like trigonometry or like calculus or like differential equations
Andreas,i've seen an octagon in real life in like eight years
Andreas,"So like, yeah, I feel like the education system should, you know, be focused towards like the actual useful information that, you know"
Andreas,like adults need to to have to you know like live their life and like one of the basis is that is like if you have money what to do it that how to protect it how to invest it how to like figure out risk and stuff like that like if you're
Andreas,"There's a huge difference of people, whether their risk appetite is investing in index funds with the money they make in the year for a 2% to 5% yearly gain or degenerates like us that are willing to gamble with large amounts of leverage"
Andreas,"More than everything, yeah"
CL207,"Yeah, way more"
CL207,Way more than everything
Andreas,"Exactly, but just a fundamental understanding of both those sides and an ability to look at your own finances, look at the money that you have, look at the opportunities you have with your money, and make an educated guess or certain allocations of"
Andreas,"I'll put X amount in like these risky assets, but I'll have like Y amount and like a more stable asset and that should set me up nicely for the future"
Andreas,I feel like that stuff like that isn't taught at all
Andreas,"And like, even for me, like I sort of had just to learn that on the go, just like trial and error"
Andreas,"Like I definitely, when I first got into crypto, I definitely"
Andreas,lost a bunch of money doing stupid shit that I probably shouldn't have done
Andreas,"But in retrospect, it's just a learning experience"
Andreas,You look back and you learn from the experience and then try to adjust in the future not to do it
CL207,"I had no like, like when I finished school, like I didn't apply to a job, like not sure why"
CL207,"And then all my friends are like, yeah"
CL207,I'm going to this
CL207,"Oh, I got an internship to begin with, uh, but it's Intel and or like some shit"
CL207,"And I'm like, Oh, cool"
CL207,"I, I have nothing to say"
CL207,And then just traded this Ponzi and like had to learn to go
CL207,Never took a single finance course
CL207,"Like, yeah, definitely"
CL207,I had to
Andreas,"Yeah, but before I got into like, I was mainly just started trading like the"
Andreas,"was like the XBT perpetual, the Bitcoin perpetual on Baymax"
Andreas,"Before that, I did not take a single course on finance"
Andreas,"I didn't know a lot of the terms that people were using, stuff like that"
Andreas,I was basically just clicking buttons
Andreas,"I think number go up, I long, I think number go down, I short"
Andreas,Very elementary stuff
Andreas,"But at the time, it was"
Andreas,"It worked, I guess"
Andreas,It is what it is
Andreas,"But a lot of the stuff, you're not really taught"
Andreas,You just pick up with experience
Andreas,I talk with a lot of traditional finance people that get into trading crypto
Andreas,"They're successful trading normal markets, and then they get into crypto"
Andreas,A lot of the concepts
Andreas,"don't transfer over, like some concepts do transfer over, but a lot of the concepts don't transfer over that well, just like the volatility, the fact that like the markets are 24 hours, the fact that like liquidity is like fragmented versus like everything on like a centralized limit order book and stuff like that"
Jamo,The obscene counterparty risk
Andreas,"Yeah, the technical hurdles for like, you know, like something, especially if you want to like a lot of the, a lot of the per volume is moving to decentralized exchanges on like layer two, just to get to figure out the tech hurdles for generally self custody, but like, you know, bridging assets over there, stuff like that"
CL207,"And then one day you're treating the, you know, the most popular product, the PTC USDT, and then tethered depex, three pegs, three bibs"
CL207,"And then you're, yeah"
CL207,And then you're scared
CL207,There's a lot of shit going on
Andreas,"Yeah, you're panicked selling your tether thinking it's going to go to zero"
Andreas,"I'm on the other side of the trade of buying that tether at like 90, 95 cents"
Andreas,"We actually, didn't we do a podcast episode on that one"
Andreas,"It wasn't tether, it was USDC"
Andreas,I ran the numbers and I just told everyone to just buy up the idiots dumping their USDC because they think like
Andreas,"Was it like, so our Silicon Valley bank was insolvent"
CL207,I did actually panic sell
CL207,"It was pretty bad, but I actually bought, I just bought spot instead"
CL207,"So I was just like, I'll put a few percent in versus it was kind of like, okay, I guess"
CL207,"Like, I don't know anything about signature banks"
CL207,"I'm just like, yeah, you know, I'm going to go and eat going fucking Ethereum bro"
CL207,Like fuck this shit
Andreas,"Yeah, I remember the day that happened and I was like digging through like the the circle documents, figuring out like how much money they actually had in like these banks and"
Andreas,"like exactly what impact like they, the, if, if the, the bank didn't return any of their money and yeah, to me, the situation was like super ridiculous because like, I think I read the numbers and like high valued, uh, USDC at like, I'll say like 97 cents"
Andreas,"If, if the, the bank literally returned like zero, no money on, on their balance and like"
Andreas,Circle didn't dig into their profits or dig into their treasury to cover the hole
Andreas,So that was worst case scenario
Andreas,"And then I don't think historically speaking, when banks go insolvent, it's not like FTX"
Andreas,It's not like when a crypto exchange goes insolvent or something
Andreas,Banks go insolvent when they're probably
Andreas,2% to 5% off what they're holding should be and they can't pay out or something like that
Andreas,and then they experience a bank run
Andreas,"If you have a bank that goes insolvent, it's never going to be like you're losing 50% of your deposits unless it's some Venezuelan"
Andreas,to see to your bank that you're depositing funds in
CL207,Learn something new today
CL207,"If my bank's insolvent, I lose 3% confirmed by the real estate GCR"
Andreas,You actually don't lose anything if you have an American bank because FDIC insurance covers a majority of it
Andreas,It's very very hard to lose money like in a bank account
Andreas,"That's that's the one thing that traditional finance has going for it is it's very easy to lose crypto like everywhere like But if you just put your money in a bank account like it doesn't really matter which bank it's it's it's mostly safe and if it's not safe, it's like"
Andreas,not safe by like a few basis points
Andreas,"It's not, it's not, not, not safe by like 50 or a hundred percent of your balance"
CL207,"Oh, also as a, as, as real estate GCR, I was going to ask about like, how is this right"
CL207,"Um, yeah, like for like me, like mid tier homes, right"
CL207,"Like, cause I'm not like elite, like hyper both whatever, like if I buy like, uh, is it, am I buying the top right now"
CL207,"But like the shit only goes up, right"
CL207,Like I'm staying in hotels as like a funding way to like shore housing and it's not working out for me at all
Andreas,"I think my advice to you would be, if anyone's watching this, this is definitely not financial advice"
Andreas,"People that invest in real estate as an investment rather than just wanting to have the real estate, it doesn't necessarily work out and it's probably not an effective use of their capital"
Andreas,"So if I were you and looking at buying a place, I wouldn't care about the market cycles at all"
Andreas,"Because if you're like a crypto, the fluctuations of the real estate price from a market price, you purchase that and then what you can sell it at within five or 10 years"
Andreas,isn't going to be nearly as impactful as your daily swings of just trading or holding your crypto
Andreas,The volatility isn't necessarily there
Andreas,And then there's quite a few costs and quite a few
Andreas,like annoyances with owning real estate
Andreas,"So it like, I think the advice is like, if you're looking at it as an investment, or if you're concerned, if the price goes up, or if you're buying the top, then just don't buy like it's, it's not worth it"
Andreas,"But if there's like a place that you would utilize effectively that you like, like, just buy it and keep it and be indifferent about the price, because the price fluctuation is going to, it's"
Andreas,"In the worst case scenario, it's not going to trade close to half the shitcoins you're trading on a day-to-day basis"
CL207,But I don't know
CL207,Maybe it's just a trader mindset
CL207,I just don't want to buy the top
CL207,"Yeah, that's fair"
Andreas,"Yeah, I honestly don't know"
Andreas,It depends on a lot of factors
Andreas,"I think that's a very, very small concern on your overall list of concerns"
Andreas,If you have a checklist going into this as to deciding whether you buy or whether you don't buy
Andreas,"The housing market cycle should be very, very low on the list of what you're looking at"
Jamo,And it's way more comfortable to run TRIP on your house than on your crypto holdings
Andreas,"I think that the main thing is just like, again, it's like an asset that you're using for personal utility, right"
Andreas,So it's far more important
Andreas,"that you think the purchase is good, relatively speaking, to your needs rather than the inherent fiat value of the asset five or 10 years from now"
Andreas,That is pretty secondary
CL207,I should just look at it like fashion then
CL207,"Like, oh, I bought this nice piece of jacket"
CL207,"Oh, wait, the secondary market went down like $200"
Andreas,"Or like, I'm like, I guess like watches or women's handbags or whatever"
Andreas,"It's, it's the, the, the, there are people that like are actually actively like trading those markets that are, you know, in it, in it for profit"
Andreas,"Um, but if, if you're like inexperienced and you want to get in, you just like one, like a nice watch or a nice bag, just like, I think the number one advice is just like, figure out like what works for you and what, uh, what, what you want rather than, you know, like the"
Andreas,the retention of value or the actual stage in the market you're in
CL207,Our advice has been obtained
CL207,for from real estate GCR
CL207,"Yeah, real estate GCR"
Andreas,"So before we let you go today, I feel like we should talk a little bit more about crypto"
Andreas,So like one final topic
Andreas,Do you have a general outlook on crypto as a whole
Andreas,I guess in the next like end of year to maybe one year
Andreas,Like I know that that there's a lot of
Andreas,"You know, prevailing narratives happening like the what's going on with the Bitcoin ETF, are there going to be inflows, maybe outflows, the US presidential election, potentially either Solana ETFs, the the Gox coins, like there's a lot of stuff that's either like"
Andreas,supply overhang or that needs to be sold or there's huge potential inflows and stuff like that
Andreas,Do you have a general view as to what you think will happen
CL207,"So this is, I think one of my most, my biggest weakness is like this kind of views because like I've always treated on like day to day, week to week and most short-term stuff"
CL207,Maybe I'm most like one or two months
CL207,"Like I don't think I've ever had a trade where I'm like, yeah, like Q4 is going to pop like, and we're in Q2 right now"
CL207,Like that just never happened
CL207,"Overall, I do tend to think that people are over-exaggerating the top signals"
CL207,"Because if you go relatively cycle by cycle, DeFi summer was absolutely crazy, even for people who went through 2017"
CL207,"And they were like, yo, this is crazy"
CL207,"And then when the first DeFi pullback, everyone was shorting"
CL207,"So relatively, I think we're kind of similar in that celebs are popping in and that's to me just about as crazy as 2021, if not even a bit less just because we don't have that stimmy checks, we don't have that kind of stuff"
CL207,"Um, and I think my views are really weak by the way, just cause like, I'm an absolute retard when it comes to like, just kind of like macro view"
CL207,Cause I know nothing about macro
CL207,I didn't even know Trump's was favored until like GCR set in
CL207,"And I'm like, yeah"
CL207,I have to trust like politics GCR or like literally him side
CL207,"Like he is literally the go of politics, right"
CL207,"So I'm like, he's like, yeah"
CL207,"I'm like, okay"
CL207,Trump won guys
CL207,"Like, yeah, like, I don't know anything about like"
CL207,and he's going to somehow pump the markets
CL207,I heard like apparently it's super bullish and he's like confirmed at this point
CL207,Basically they could even assassinate him
CL207,"He, my bro, my bro literally turned his head and it's like just nailed it"
CL207,"Like, like it's so crazy"
CL207,"Like, so I got"
CL207,I don't have too much
CL207,"I think I heard like a third of the Gox points are bought out and then like some, something like that"
CL207,"And then it's like, yeah"
CL207,"but I don't know if they're going to sell, right"
CL207,They're definitely in for a profit too
CL207,"So like, yeah"
CL207,"Yeah, like the last few weeks were definitely a bit more like shorter and like less allocated"
CL207,And then this week inflows were really strong so far
CL207,"So that's been really promising at least like, like for the first time we have like a 30% like pullback where like, you know, TradFi"
CL207,"bros are like, yeah"
CL207,"we're bidding like 200 mil inflow, 300 mil inflow"
CL207,So that's like
CL207,"impressive, I guess"
CL207,"Cause like at some point, I think people were talking about like, Oh, if we have a 30% pullback, the ETF is going to start panic sailing or something"
CL207,And we didn't really see too much of that
CL207,So that's pretty strong to me
CL207,"But I'm always like, like on crypto, I'm always like softly perma bullish, I guess"
CL207,"I definitely am like, definitely do call cycle tops like last cycle"
CL207,I kind of did
CL207,definitely do get bearish
CL207,"But yeah, I think we're still like somewhat pre definitely"
Andreas,"I recently had like a kind of bearish ever since we hit like, like over 70k Bitcoin and like a lot of the events may be like a bit bearish and then"
Andreas,"Like I would post about it like when Bitcoin is trading at like, say it's like 68K"
Andreas,"And then you would just have people like, I don't really have that big of a following on Twitter"
Andreas,Just like mostly people I know and stuff like that
Andreas,"But then like I do have, you know, just like randoms, like calling me an idiot and saying like, look at this bottom signal"
Andreas,"Like, look at this loser"
Jamo,"It's so rough, man"
Jamo,"You got a small following, but they're very quick to insult you"
Andreas,"Yeah, they're really quick to insult me"
Andreas,But then there was a pullback
Andreas,Bitcoin went down to 55k and I just went back one day and just tweeted everyone that said I was about to check in on them
CL207,"The QRTs goes hard, yeah"
Andreas,"Half of them blocked me, I noticed"
Andreas,This was pretty funny
Andreas,One final question
Andreas,"If you were to describe yourself, what GCR would you be"
CL207,"Maybe, I don't know, lifestyle GCR"
CL207,"Yeah, because I think I just live my own fantasy, my own world"
CL207,I absolutely do not care about anyone's opinion on what I'm doing
CL207,"I'm dirty in my bubble, very moisturized and like in a hotel right now as we speak"
CL207,"Yeah, actually first time at, I'm at right now, first time staying"
CL207,Probably a decent review at the end of the stay
CL207,"Yeah, I still haven't explored even all the hotels because I'm pretty like autistic in the way"
CL207,I need to do the same thing
CL207,"So if I go to a new hotel, where do I go to get coffee and breakfast again"
CL207,Do I have to go here now
CL207,"like a, I don't know, habit break"
CL207,So I was like staying at like some other hotel for like months
CL207,"Whenever I go, I was there"
Andreas,"Is there like a, is there like a favorite hotel or like a hotel chain that you favor or that you, that you would stay above all else"
Andreas,"I'm curious because, cause I also, I also am a bit of a hotel kind of store"
CL207,"Uh, so, uh, I've not stayed at too much, like chain hotels, honestly"
CL207,"I've always preferred medium, smaller brands"
CL207,"Um, I guess I was impressed by like Pendry service when I was like checking in"
CL207,"It's just like, I had three massive chat dudes, like protecting me, opening the door and carrying my luggage up"
CL207,"I was like, wow, you know, even four seasons didn't do this"
CL207,This is crazy
CL207,"Uh, I don't know if you've heard of Pendry, but they don't, they only have like, I don't know, like five branch or something"
CL207,"Yeah, honestly, nothing too notable"
CL207,Like Marriott stole my unisex socks because I just have a package there
CL207,"Physical one, it was worth 80 grand when it was thrown away by them"
CL207,"Yeah, I just literally had it on my desk"
CL207,It literally just looked like a cardboard box that's empty because it weighs so little
CL207,They literally thought it was trash and threw it away
CL207,"I'm like, dude, we need to go to the trash truck right now to get it back"
CL207,It's a highly valuable personal item
CL207,"And they're like, oh, it's gone, bro"
CL207,I don't know what you're talking about
CL207,They don't remember what they threw away
CL207,"I'm like, all right, I'm never coming back"
Andreas,I'm a pretty big almond maximalist
Andreas,I like all the almond properties a lot
Andreas,"I don't know if you stay in any of them, but they're really, really nice"
Andreas,There's only like two or three that I disliked and I've been to quite a few of them
CL207,I've only been to one in New York and I didn't even stay there
CL207,I just went there for
CL207,"I went to the bar and then I went to the restaurant in it and then, cause my friend was staying there and he showed me around and I was like, yeah, that's very impressive"
CL207,I'm not paying like five grand a day
CL207,Like I'm not like hyper wealth
Andreas,They are like very overpriced
CL207,"But yeah, especially for me, like I'm not hyper wealth"
CL207,and I do this every day
CL207,"Like I literally cannot do a five, 10 grand, like that kind of stuff every day for years"
CL207,"So it's just like, yeah"
Andreas,and then the next full market and the next full market
Andreas,numbers were just going up
Andreas,He was trading and making whatever amount a day
Andreas,I think he had a small apartment and he just moved
Andreas,"It was during COVID, so the hotels were pretty empty"
Andreas,Then he just moved to a five-star hotel and just lived there for six months
Andreas,"He would walk back to his condo and do laundry every week, but then just go back to the hotel and stuff like that"
CL207,"Yeah, sounds like my dream, yeah"
CL207,"Except I just give them my laundry and they overcharge me by like $200, yeah"
Andreas,"He was, he was actually telling me that they would like send them an invoice and he would have his billing address on it and they would look at it as billing address"
Andreas,"And they were like, it was next door"
Andreas,Like you live next door to this place and you're just been here for like six months
Jamo,Every condo was a rich Carlton in Tokyo
Andreas,It was the rich Carlton in Tokyo
CL207,"Wait, how much was it in COVID like worth $250 a night"
Andreas,He told me he paid like around $500 a night for six months straight
CL207,"Even during COVID, it was $500"
Andreas,"I mean, it's like $1,000 or $2,000 a night, I think there"
Jamo,He was on the FTX leaderboard
Jamo,He was fine then
Andreas,I think he's like no longer fine now
Andreas,The FDX leader board doesn't have as much value as it used to
CL207,"I'm just doing like around between five, maybe like three to one K, 300 to one K that varies a lot"
Andreas,That's pretty reasonable
CL207,"Yeah, for sure"
Andreas,I think that's all the topics
Andreas,"I had a few, but we've already gone like"
Andreas,quite some time
Andreas,"Andreas, is there anything you wanted to add or"
Jamo,"No, I think the lifestyle GFCR is pretty tough to top"
Andreas,"Kat, do you have any other topics you want to cover before we go today"
CL207,"Yeah, I'll bring it up in the next pod"
CL207,"Oh, that means we're in part two"
Andreas,We'll be more prepared for that one
Andreas,Today we just sort of
Andreas,Like we just came in and started chatting about like whatever we wanted to talk about basically
Andreas,"All right, I think that's all we have for today"
Andreas,I appreciate you coming on and we'll see you next time
Andreas,"Yeah, thank you"
CL207,"Yeah, thank you guys"
